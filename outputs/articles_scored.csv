Even with a lot of major title races already decided (or close to it), the month of May is a legitimate roller coaster: We have the semis and finals of UEFA's three continental tournaments, major cup finals, fights over Champions League spots for next season, desperate promotion and relegation plot twists, minor league title chases and the glory that is final-matchday whip-around coverage.

The eventual winners of this season’s Caf Champions League will take home $4 million (R75 million). That number has grown from $2.5 million in 2022. Orlando Pirates must negotiate a tough second-leg semi-final clash in Egypt against Pyramids after a hard-fought 0-0 draw in the first leg. If they advance to the final, either Mamelodi Sundowns or defending champions Al Ahly await them in another two-legged affair to crown the continent’s finest side. Sundowns meet Al Ahly on Friday, 25 April at 18:00 after a goalless first leg. Pyramids vs Pirates kicks off at 20:00 on the same day. What a feast of football.

Mofokeng will be key

Relebohile Mofokeng has racked up a staggering 41 appearances in the 2024-2025 season across all competitions. Arguably the club’s most important operator, he’s produced 10 goals and 13 assists in those matches. It’s a stellar output for any player, let alone one who’s just exited his teens. Is there a succession plan for when he inevitably leaves for a wealthier league abroad? Money can buy good players, but some stars are priceless. Pirates have unearthed a new teenager, but he’s unlikely to make an impact for some time.

Open Extended Reactions

Carlo Ancelotti has said Real Madrid are ""in Champions League mode"" ahead of their final clash with Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on Saturday.

Madrid played their last LaLiga game of the season on Saturday -- a 0-0 draw with Real Betis -- having wrapped up the league title weeks earlier, and now have a week to prepare for the Champions League final.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)

The Spanish giants are the most successful team in European Cup history, winning the competition 14 times, including five in the last decade.

""The cold sweat arrives on Saturday afternoon,"" Ancelotti said at Madrid's pre-final media day at their Valdebebas training ground.

""The fear, that's normal. I have experience. My team gives me confidence and hope. They look focused on the game. They're in Champions League mode.""

Ancelotti's teams have reached nine European Cup finals -- three as a player, and six as a manager -- and he is now hoping to land his second Champions League since returning to Madrid in 2021 for his second spell as coach.

""It's always the same ahead of these games,"" he said. ""Excitement, happiness, being involved in the most important game of the season... We're not on holiday yet, and the other teams are. They'll see the game on TV.""

Ancelotti refused to confirm that back-from-injury Thibaut Courtois would start the final in goal, ahead of Andriy Lunin, as ESPN has reported.

""It's very difficult,"" Ancelotti said. ""Of course it's really difficult, because both of them deserve to play this final. Lunin has had a fantastic season, Courtois is back from his injury.""

""One of the two is going to play,"" he added, laughing, ""and the other will be on the bench.""

The Italian coach said midfielder Toni Kroos -- who announced his retirement last week -- doesn't need another trophy to be remembered as a club legend.

""Let's hope he can end his career with the Champions League, he deserves it,"" Ancelotti said. ""He's gone down in Real Madrid history, he's already there, but ending with a Champions League would be fantastic.""",espn.co.uk,2024-05-27T15:57:45.000000Z,https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/40227489/ancelotti-says-real-madrid-champions-league-final-mode,1.0

SEOUL, April 23 (Yonhap) -- Having bagged a crucial win at home, South Korean champions Ulsan HD FC will now visit Japanese foes Yokohama F. Marinos this week as they chase their first Asian club football title in four years.

Ulsan and Yokohama will square off in the second leg of the semifinals of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Yokohama International Stadium in Yokohama, Japan.

Ulsan won the opening leg last week at home by 1-0, with midfielder Lee Dong-gyeong's 19th-minute goal providing the difference.

Ulsan just need to avoid a loss Wednesday, and they will punch their ticket to the two-legged final next month. The away goals rule is no longer in effect, and extra time and a penalty shootout will be used to determine the winner if necessary.

For the knockouts, teams have been split into East and West regions. Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates defeated Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia 4-2 in the first leg of the semifinals in the West Region last week, with their return leg set for Tuesday night in Riyadh.

Ulsan have won two AFC Champions League titles, most recently in 2020, when they defeated the Iranian side Persepolis 2-1 in the one-and-done final match.

They have since collected two domestic trophies, winning the K League 1 titles in 2022 and 2023. And their ""three-peat"" bid is off to a solid start this year, as they rank third with 14 points, three back of the league-leading Pohang Steelers but with one match in hand. Ulsan lead all clubs with 16 goals in seven matches.

Lee Dong-gyeong has been involved in 10 of those goals, with six goals and a league-best four assists. He was the lone goal scorer in last week's win, and Ulsan will look to other attackers to step up their game.

Forward Joo Min-kyu netted three goals in the round of 16 but has been held off the scoresheet since. The two-time K League 1 scoring champion is a threat to go off at any moment, though.

Ulsan's Hungarian forward Martin Adam leads Ulsan with five goals for this year's Champions League, but all five came during the group stage.

At the other end, goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo has been sharp in the knockout stage, having conceded only two goals in five matches.

Inter Milan looked firmly in control early on, racing to a 2-0 lead with a quick double one of which came from Denzel Dumfries, who was in inspired form. But the Italian side’s dominance was short-lived, as teenage sensation Lamine Yamal sparked a spirited Barcelona comeback.

The second half saw more drama unfold, with Dumfries striking again to put Inter ahead in the 63rd minute. But Barcelona refused to bow out. This time it was Raphinha who answered the call his powerful strike from distance took a deflection off Sommer and found the back of the net to make it 3-3.

The Angolan spoke to The South African before the draw for the continental league. The former Cape Town City FC shot-stopper said he was longing for a dance with the Tshwane giants.

Why the CAF Champions League finest wants Sundowns

The South African then asked the former Angolan international how far he thinks Petro de Luanda can go in this CAF Champions League race. In reply, Hugo Marques quoted the motto of the African Football League winners, saying: “The sky is the limit. I just want Sundowns in the final.”

Hugo Marques was a revelation in this CAF Champions League group stages. He kept clean sheets in all six matches as Petro de Luanda qualified for the quarterfinals. The clean-shaven custodian attributed his rich vein of form to teamwork. He said: “Teamwork. I have the best defenders in Africa. Pedro Pinto, Inacio Miguel, Kinito, Anderson, Eddi Afonso, Vidinho and To Carneiro.” He further expressed his admiration for Sundowns keeper Ronwen Williams, describing him as the best on the continent.

CAF Champions League star reveals secret amid Sundowns wish

His comments come amid excitement following the CAF Champions League quarterfinal line-up. The draw held on Tuesday saw the Angolans pitied against TP Mazembe, whereas the DStv Premiership invincible date Young Africans (Yanga). The other ties have Al Ahly taking on Simba SC, whereas Esperance Sportive de Tunis meets Asec Mimosa. First-leg quarterfinal matches are scheduled for the weekend of March 29 and 30, 2024. Second-leg quarterfinal games will take place on the weekend of April 5 and 6, 2024, according to CAF. Al Ahly are the defending champions.

How Hugo Marques fared at Cape Town City

Hugo Marques impressed when he featured in 34 matches for Cape Town City. Little wonder he was voted the DStv Premiership’s best keeper in the 2021-2022 season. However, he took many by surprise in South African football circles when he requested the management of the Citizens to release him from his contract in August 2022. His deal with the Cape Town-based outfit was then set to end the following year in June.

Recoup of the Angolan’s time in DStv Premiership

Now back home, the Angolan has since re-established himself as one of the best keepers in the Girabola league, and the CAF Champions League. The veteran player has always relished meetings against Sundowns as such games remind him of his DStv Premiership spell. The Pretoria-based side last met the Angolans on October 21, 2023. The Rulani Mokwena-led outfit won the quarterfinal first-leg 2-0 before completing the job three days later with a goalless draw in the reverse fixture.",thesouthafrican.com,2024-03-13T10:21:46.000000Z,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/sport/soccer/petro-de-luanda-goalkeeper-hugo-marques-has-expressed-his-wish-to-meet-mamelodi-sundowns-in-the-caf-champions-league-final/,0.0
28aaaba2-c6fa-4aab-8f8f-928512cdbd2d,Europe’s heavyweights await Champions League quarter-final fate,"PARIS: This Friday’s Champions League quarter-final draw is set to throw up a series of heavyweight ties after a midweek in which penalty shoot-out drama really brought Europe’s elite club competition to life.

Goalkeeper Jan Oblak’s heroics in Atletico Madrid’s shoot-out win over last season’s runners-up Inter Milan on Wednesday — after the Spanish club came from behind in their last-16 tie — followed Arsenal’s triumph on penalties against Porto a day earlier.

Tuesday also saw Barcelona deliver a rousing performance to see off Napoli and make it through to the quarter-finals for the first time since their 8-2 annihilation at the hands of Bayern Munich in 2020 in Lisbon, at the height of the Covid crisis.

With record 14-time champions Real Madrid already having secured their last-eight berth, it means three Spanish clubs will be represented in the draw.

They are joined by two English sides in Arsenal and holders Manchester City, as well as the German duo of Bayern and Borussia Dortmund, and French giants Paris St Germain.

The surprise is that none of Italy’s representatives reached the next stage, a year after Inter pushed City close in the final having eliminated neighbours AC Milan in the last four.

Only three of last season’s quarter-finalists — City, Real and Bayern — have made it back to the last eight this time, suggesting there is still a real degree of variety and unpredictability to the competition.

Yet the recent last-16 ties also more than hinted at the ever-growing polarisation at the very top of European football.

FC Copenhagen could never really compete with Pep Guardiola’s City, while getting the better of PSG proved a step too far for Real Sociedad and Bayern ultimately brushed aside Lazio despite losing the first leg away.

Only the mega-rich can now aspire to winning the Champions League, with four of the quarter-finalists posting revenue last season of over 800 million euros ($874m) according to this year’s Deloitte Football Money League.

Going by Deloitte’s ranking, all eight quarter-finalists were in the top 15 clubs in the world last season in terms of income — Atletico had the lowest at just over 364 million euros.

Diego Simeone’s side were the only team to win against a richer club in the last 16, and even then Inter generated only marginally more money last season.

The current format of the Champions League has been in place for two decades and will be changed for next season, when UEFA will revolutionise its flagship tournament by replacing the group stage with a league phase featuring 36 clubs, up from 32 now.

Clubs will play eight games in the league phase, instead of six in the old group stage, all against different opponents in what is known as the “Swiss system”.

It remains to be seen if that will somehow improve the Champions League, when the major issue appears to be that the number of candidates to win the trophy is getting narrower.

Competing with City is not just an issue for Copenhagen, but for all clubs.

Having won the trophy for the first time last season, they are into the quarter-finals for the seventh year running.

Whether anyone can prevent them retaining the title may in large part come down to the draw, with the path to the final being determined on Friday when the semi-final match-ups will also be decided.

Winners in 2022, Real may be the best equipped to beat City among all the sides left in the quarter-finals, but they were blown away by them in last season’s semi-finals.

Bayern are into the quarter-finals for the 12th time in 13 years. They may be trailing behind Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga, but they remain a formidable prospect in Europe.

Three of the remaining contenders have never won the trophy, in Arsenal, Atletico and PSG, the French side reaching the final in 2020, when they lost to Bayern.

They are far from a complete team now, but will be eager to seize their last chance to win the Champions League before Kylian Mbappe departs.

Arsenal see off Porto to stamp Champions League quarter-final ticket

The Gunners needed a penalty shootout to eventually see off Sergio Conceicao’s Porto team at Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night. Arsenal won the second leg 1-0 after extra time which meant the tie ended 1-1 on aggregate. Spanish goalkeeper David Raya was the hero, saving two of Porto’s spot-kicks in the shootout. It’s the first time Arsenal have reached the last eight of this competition since 2010. Ironically, it was also Porto they eliminated at this stage 14 years ago.

All the usual suspects qualify, but when is the Champion League quarter-final draw?

Defending champions Man City, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona and PSG will also contest this season’s quarterfinals. Atletico Madrid vs Inter Milan (0-1 aggregate) and Borussia Dortmund vs PSV Eindhoven (1-1 aggregate) are Wednesday’s two Round of 16 clashes, after which the QF lineup will be complete. The draw takes place on Friday 15 March from Nyon, Switzerland starting at 13:00 RSA time.

Round of 16 recap

Barcelona saw off defending Italian champions Napoli 4-2 on aggregate after a 3-1 win at the Nou Camp. Real Madrid made heavy weather of their tie with German side RB Leipzig, eventually prevailing 2-1 on aggregate. Defending champions Manchester City were far too strong for Danish outfit FC Copenhagen, winning both legs 3-1. Harry Kane bagged a double for Bayern Munich as the Bavarian giants overturned a 1-0 first-leg deficit to see off Lazio 3-1 on aggregate. French giants PSG off LaLiga’s Real Sociedad 4-1 over two legs. Kylian Mbappe, who else, scored three of their four goals in the tie. The fantastic Frenchman is reportedly off to Real Madrid next season.

The UEFA Champions League draw will look a little different next season

A new expanded Champions League format from next season means computers will be used to make the draw. Clubs will be drawn manually and then the computer will take over and select their eight group opponents. That’s an issue for 2024/25 though.

The 2024 Champions League final is set -- 14-time winners Real Madrid will face 1997 champions Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on June 1 aiming to succeed Manchester City by lifting the trophy in London.

Madrid be overwhelming favourites with Carlo Ancelotti's side having just clinched a record-extending 36th LaLiga title. In contrast, Edin Terzic's Dortmund sit in fifth position in the Bundesliga, 24 points behind unbeaten champions Bayer Leverkusen.

Despite their poor domestic campaign, Dortmund have defied the odds to make it all the way to Wembley. They will be seeking to make it second-time lucky at Wembley after their loss against Bayern Munich in the 2013 final.

For Madrid, however, the motivation is the same whenever they reach the Champions League final: to stretch their already huge gap over the next-most successful club, AC Milan with seven titles, by winning it for a 15th time.

It will the first meeting between Madrid and Dortmund in a European Cup/Champions League final, so here's the way-too-early preview of next month's showpiece clash.

Real Madrid will take on Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. Getty

How the two teams got there

Madrid cruised into the knockout stages by winning all six games in Group C against Braga, Napoli and Union Berlin.

Ancelotti's team, who last lifted the trophy in 2022 by beating Liverpool 1-0 in Paris, scored 16 goals and conceded seven in a routine group stage campaign.

Dortmund emerged as winners of Group F, with home and away victories against Newcastle United proving key to their success in sealing qualification from a group that also included Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan.

In contrast to Madrid's free-scoring qualification from their group, however, Dortmund scored just seven goals in their six games, but kept it tight defensively by conceding only four goals.

Both teams have had to fight their way through the knockout rounds to reach the final, however.

Madrid secured a narrow, and at times tense, round-of-16 tie victory against RB Leipzig by progressing 2-1 on aggregate, before eliminating holders Man City 4-3 in a penalty shootout following a 4-4 aggregate draw.

And Madrid's semifinal win against Bayern was pure drama, with two late goals from substitute Joselu sealing a 2-1 second-leg win at the Bernabeu, and 4-3 aggregate success. Bayern looked set for the final until Joselu scored in the 88th and 91st minutes.

Meanwhile, Dortmund benefited from being in the easier half of the draw, avoiding all of the tournament favourites, and started out with a 3-1 aggregate win against Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in the round of 16.

A 5-4 quarterfinal triumph over Atlético Madrid followed before Terzic's team eliminated PSG with two 1-0 wins.

Who has the edge?

It has been a long time since Real Madrid went into a Champions League final as anything other than favourites but no team has been such heavy underdogs as Dortmund will be, perhaps since Liverpool faced Ancelotti's all-conquering AC Milan in Istanbul in 2005.

That final 19 years ago turned out to be one of the most memorable of all time, with Liverpool fighting back from 3-0 down at half-time to beat Milan on penalties, so Dortmund certainly know where to look for inspiration at Wembley.

Madrid have the tournament pedigree. This will be their sixth final in 11 years -- and they won the other five. Madrid haven't lost a Champions League final since 1981, winning eight since then.

Dortmund have only won the Champions League once, in 1997, when Ottmar Hitzfeld's team beat Juventus in Munich. Their only other appearance in the final ended in defeat against Bayern at Wembley in 2013.

The 2024 UEFA Women's Champions League final is set: eight-time winners Lyon will face champions Barcelona, who are aiming for a second title in three years, at the San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao on May 25.

French giants Lyon got the better of their Spanish rivals in the 2019 final and again in 2022. Between them, the pair will have won the past nine titles once the dust has settled on Saturday.

What's in store this time? Here's a preview of the top women's club match in European football.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)

What state are Lyon in going into the match?

Lyon are in good form and good humour coming into the final, which will be their 11th Women's Champions League final appearance to date. Their last match was the Division 1 Féminine playoff final against Paris Saint-Germain, which they won with relative ease last weekend. In preparation for their last two games of the season, manager Sonia Bompastor rotated the squad heavily to give her players some rest.

Everything just feels right for Lyon. They've added another league trophy to their haul and they're back where they belong, ready to fight for Europe's biggest prize. Although she is unlikely to start in Bilbao, the return of talismanic attacker Ada Hegerberg from injury will also give Les Fenottes a boost.

Lyon will once again be going into a final in which they are not the favourites, but they will be feeling good about their chances of lifting the trophy for a ninth time. -- Sophie Lawson

What state are Barcelona in going into the match?

Barcelona completed a domestic treble at the weekend, thumping Real Sociedad 8-0 in the final of the Copa de la Reina, having already won a fifth consecutive Liga F title and the Spanish Supercopa earlier this season. ""Three down, one to go,"" said forward Mariona Caldentey after the thrashing of La Real. That is a good demonstration of where Barcelona's heads are at the moment -- for all the success they have tasted in recent years, they are still focused on two challenges they feel they have left to tick off. The first is winning a quadruple for the first time ever; the second is beating Lyon.

""[Winning the final against them] would be the cherry on top of the cake,"" defender Marta Torrejón told ESPN ahead of Saturday's game.

The mood is buoyant and the squad is in good shape. Alexia Putellas and Fridolina Rolfö have both strung together a run of games in recent months after injury problems earlier this season, with centre-back María León the only major absentee expected this weekend.

However, there are some issues. The first is the psychological barrier of never having beaten the French champions. The second is the doubt sowed during the semifinal win over Chelsea. After losing the first leg -- Barcelona's first home loss in five years -- they turned things around at Stamford Bridge, but it was far from easy, and it demonstrated they can be neutralized in attack. -- Sam Marsden",espn.com,2024-05-23T08:27:02.000000Z,https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/40190600/womens-champions-league-final-lyon-barcelona-win,1.0

f2400bcc-2816-4b1f-a969-3187f75516b4,"Why Inter will win the Champions League final vs. PSG: Experience, Lautaro Martinez and more","Inter will face PSG on May 31 at the Allianz Arena in Munich for the 2024-25 edition of the UEFA Champions League final in what is expected to be the most anticipated game of the season. Inter are chasing their fourth Champions League trophy in their history, as they won the tournament in 1964, 1965, and lastly in 2010 under manager Jose Mourinho, when the Nerazzurri also won the treble. Since then, they have only reached the final once, two years ago in 2023, when Simone Inzaghi's team lost to Manchester City in the Istanbul final with a goal scored by Spanish midfielder Rodri. Two years later, Inter are back in the final and they will face Luis Enrique's PSG, that are playing their second ever Champions League final, after losing the 2020 edition to Bayern Munich, as the French giants are yet to lift their first ever Champions League trophy in their history. Let's now take a closer look at Inter and why they can win the final:

Here's the case for PSG to win.

Preferred Inter lineup

Ideal Inter XI: Yann Sommer; Benjamin Pavard, Francesco Acerbi, Alessandro Bastoni; Denzel Dumfries, Nicolo Barella, Hakan Calhanoglu, Henrix Mkhitaryan, Federico Dimarco; Lautaro Martinez, Marcus Thuram

Inter's strengths

Experienced roster that already played the 2023 final

The end of a cycle coming as it might be the last chance to win the trophy for some key players

Inter's weaknesses

The depth is not great

There is no player who can turn things around alone without the team

Conceded five goals before the semifinals but then conceded six against Barcelona in two games

Why Inter will win the Champions League

1. The increased European experience

Inter qualified for the 2025 Champions League final with a different mindset and more European experience compared to the 2023 final. The Nerazzurri secured a top-eight finish in the league phase, then knocked out Feyenoord and Bayern Munich before winning against Barcelona in the semifinals. When Inter faced Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in 2023, it felt like a miraculous achievement, but Inter are now more confident, built through years of consistent progress since Inzaghi joined Inter in 2021.

2. Lautaro Martinez in his prime

Inter's Lautaro Martinez showed to be one of the best strikers around the world this season and drastically improved since the 2023 final, becoming a much more central figure of team, where he's now the captain. The Argentinian player, the heartbeat of the Nerazzurri, made an incredible comeback after a muscular injury sustained in Barcelona to return for the crucial second leg at San Siro, showing his biggest desire to lift the Champions League trophy. Having already won the 2022 World Cup and the 2021 and 2024 Copa America with Argentina, the Champions League remains Lautaro's latest ambition.

3. The last dance

This 2025 final may mark the last dance for Inter's current roster, setting the stage for a new era as the American ownership Oaktree has suggested, with a much younger roster in the coming years. Unlike the post-2010 decline after Jose Mourinho's 2009-10 treble, the upcoming revolution is designed to sustain Inter's status, led by players like the same Lautaro Martinez and Simone Inzaghi as their head coach, but winning the Champions League final would mark an unforgettable achievement.",cbssports.com,2025-05-08T21:22:22.000000Z,https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/why-inter-will-win-the-champions-league-final-vs-psg-experience-lautaro-martinez-and-more/,1.0

f5d6e318-de65-4a6e-b615-89089292920a,Lloris reveals strange gesture from Tottenham chairman before 2019 Champions League final,"Former Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris says that players received a watch engraved with “Champions League finalist” from chairman Daniel Levy before their loss to Liverpool.

The Frenchman admits the gesture left him questioning whether the club truly prioritised winning.

During his 12-year tenure with Tottenham, much of it as captain, Lloris saw the club come close to success but fall short in key moments, including two League Cup final defeats and a loss in the 2019 Champions League final.

In that game, Liverpool’s early lead came after a controversial penalty, with Lloris conceding from the spot due to a handball by teammate Moussa Sissoko.

However, Lloris recalls being unsettled before the final even started.

Levy gathered the team just days before to present them with engraved watches, which the goalkeeper felt betrayed a complacency with second place rather than striving for victory.

In his forthcoming autobiography, ‘Earning My Spurs’, Lloris shares his frustration with the gesture.

He said: “Four days before the final, Daniel Levy called us all together to announce that, with the support of a sponsor, we would each receive a luxury aviator watch from the club.

“At first, we were excited to see the elegant boxes.

🚨 NEW: Hugo Lloris revealed that Daniel Levy met with the players 4 days before the Champions League Final in 2019 that they would be receiving a luxury aviator watch from the club. The back of the watches were engraved with ‘Champions League Finalist 2019.’ Embarrassing. pic.twitter.com/gnUJF7hyWg — Spurs Connect (@Spurs_Connect) November 7, 2024

“Then we opened them and discovered that he’d had the back of each timepiece engraved with the player’s name and ‘Champions League Finalist 2019.’ ‘Finalist.’

“Who does such a thing at a moment like this? I still haven’t got over it, and I’m not alone.

“If we’d won, he wouldn’t have asked for the watches back to have ‘Winner’ engraved instead.

“I would have preferred there to be nothing on it. With an engraving like that, Levy couldn’t have been surprised if we had been 1–0 down after a couple of minutes: so it was written.”

Reflecting on the post-match reception, Lloris was disappointed by what he perceived as a lack of seriousness among some club officials and players following the defeat.

He added: “I would have liked people to come up to me and say, ‘Don’t worry, Hugo. Never again. We’ll give you the means for a comeback.’

“But when I returned to my room on the night of the final, I think I had the same feeling as Mauricio [Pochettino] and Harry [Kane]: does the club really want to win?

“Real Madrid would never have celebrated a lost final, and we shouldn’t have either.”

Lloris made his final Spurs appearance in April 2023 and later joined Los Angeles FC. He is also France’s most-capped male footballer.",101greatgoals.com,2024-11-07T13:19:02.000000Z,https://www.101greatgoals.com/football/premier-league/lloris-reveals-strange-gesture-from-tottenham-chairman-before-2019-champions-league-final/,1.0

Borussia Dortmund's (ETR: ) disappointing Bundesliga season has been overshadowed by their remarkable Champions League run, propelling them to their third final in history and sending the stock higher.

Despite finishing a lackluster fifth in the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund fans are ecstatic as their team prepares to face Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday.

The success of this season has translated into a 14% year-to-date surge in the club's shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

In May alone, the stock has gained 12% in anticipation of the final. A victory against the Spanish giants could further boost the stock's upward trajectory.

Dortmund Faces Uphill Battle

Overcoming Real Madrid will be no easy feat for the Dortmund team, as the Spanish club is the all-time leader in the competition with 14 trophies. Borussia has only won the Champions League once, in 1996/97, defeating Juventus of Italy 3-1 in the final.

They then went on to beat Dida and Bebeto's Cruzeiro 2-0 in the Intercontinental Cup final. In 2012/13, they faced fellow German side Bayern Munich in the final but lost 2-1 to finish as runners-up.

Champions League Money to Boost Revenue

The team's impressive Champions League run, eliminating giants along the way, has raised expectations not only for a title but also for revenue and profit growth.

Dortmund has left behind established clubs in the competition, including Milan (Italy), Newcastle (England), PSV (Netherlands), Atlético de Madrid (Spain), and Paris Saint-Germain (France).

In the last balance sheet, released on May 10th, the club reported total revenue of €104 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 1.7% from the previous quarter, but a net loss of €21 million.

For the previous season, 2022/23, reported in the middle of last year, total revenue was €490 million (18% higher than 2021/22) and net profit was €9.6 million (after a loss of €32 million in 2021/22).

In the current season, the club has already achieved a net profit of €49 million on revenue of €443 million. For this Champions League, Borussia projects to earn over €100 million in total – if they win the title, the UEFA prize money is an additional €20 million.

Borussia Dortmund: Strong Financials and Growth Prospects

Bullish sentiment surrounding Borussia Dortmund (BVB) stock extends beyond the possibility of winning the European title.

The club was profitable in the previous season and is expected to remain so in the near future, with projected earnings growth in 2024. Additionally, Dortmund maintains a moderate debt level (Net Debt/Total Capital of 10.9%).

On the other hand, current liquidity is low (0.6x), with short-term liabilities exceeding liquid assets. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates the stock is overbought (meaning there is a risk of a price decline).

Overall Financial Health

BVB's overall financial health score is 2.69, close to the average (2.75), indicating no cause for concern. The most notable strengths lie in the Price Trend category (score of 3.35), with an excellent return over the past three months (23.3%), and Profitability (score of 2.94), characterized by a Gross Margin of 94.8% and an average ROE of 96.2% over the past two years.

Borussia Dortmund is not the only football club with publicly traded shares. Two other traditional European teams and former Champions League winners also have shares listed on stock exchanges: Manchester United (NYSE: ) on the NYSE and Juventus Football Club (BIT: ) on the Borsa Italiana.

Manchester United won the FA Cup last Saturday against rivals Manchester City, but their underwhelming Premier League season resulted in an 18% drop in their stock price in 2024. Juventus also underperformed in Serie A, and their stock has declined by 27% this year.

MAMELODI SUNDOWNS IN CAF CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTER-FINAL DRAW

Rulani Mokwena’s side cruised through the group stages. Kabo Yellow finished with the highest points in the tournament; 13 points points from six matches.

Sundowns lost one game and drew one while winning four fixtures. The group included DR Congo giants TP Mazembe, Maurutania’s FC Nouadhibou and rising Egyptian club Pyramids FC.

Kabo Yellow’s rivals, Wydad Casablanca, failed to make the knockouts. They finished third behind Ivory Coast’s resurgent ASEC Mimosas and Tanzanian giants Simba SC.

The draw for the final eight was held in Cairo, Egypt, on Tuesday afternoon. Sundowns will take on Tanzanian giants Young Africans. The first game will be away in East Africa.

Simba will be home to Al Ahly, Mazembe will host Angolan powerhouse Petro de Luanda, while Tunisian supremos Esperance will be home to Mimosas.

DSTV PREMIERSHIP ACTION

Meanwhile, Sundowns have some PSL business to take care of.

It is the Tshwane derby against SuperSport United. The game will be at the Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight at 19:30.

With Sundowns enjoying 41 matches unbeaten in the league, SuperSport are the last team that beat Rulani Mokwena’s team.

The date was Friday, 2 September 2022. Thapelo Maseko opened the scoring after nine minutes. Bradley Grobler made it 2-0 on 45 minutes. Sundowns’ consolation came from Abubeker Nasir on 90 minutes.

Fortunately for SuperSport, Maseko is out injured this time. Sundowns will also be missing the likes of Khuliso Mudau and Mothobi Mvala.

A few Kabo Yellow players will be facing their former team in SuperSport: Ronwen Williams, Ricardo Goss, Aubrey Modiba, Teboho Mokoena, Grant Kekana and Sipho Mbule.

In the build-up to the game, Sundowns coach Rulani Mokwena said the Tshwane derby does not measure to the Soweto version.

Mokwena said the history is missing, but the rivalry between SuperSport and Sundowns can’t be questioned.

“It’s difficult to compare the derbies because the Soweto derby has a lot of history, while the Tshwane derby doesn’t have much history,” Mokwena said, as quoted by TimesLIVE.

“I think in terms of emotions, the rivalry is there. It’s a rivalry, that’s why it’s called the derby. And over the years, both teams have been extremely successful, especially in the present history.

“There are a lot of trophies that are shared between SuperSport and Sundowns both in the league and cups. So, the prestige is there. But it’s difficult to compare because the other one [Soweto derby] has the emotions and historical background.

“The other one is emotions from the recent success of both teams. You go to a space where you compare the Milan derby, for example [AC Milan and Inter Milan], with a game between Roma and Lazio [Rome derby], it’s completely different.

“Of course, a derby is a derby … everyone wants to dominate and have the bragging rights of a city,” the Sundowns tactician concluded.

Kick-off is 19:30 from the Lucas Moripe Stadium.

Erling Haaland and Vinicius Junior will star when Manchester City and Real Madrid meet in the Champions League quarterfinals this month. Mateo Villalba/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images

Georgia qualified for the Euros. Bayern Munich's title streak all but ended (and they didn't even steal the coach responsible for it). Manchester City did the opposite of seizing control of the Premier League race. We got ourselves a lopsided Champions League quarterfinal draw (and another ""Dos a Cero"" between the U.S. and Mexico).

March was a lot, and it gave us a lot to keep track of as we enter the penultimate month of the 2023-24 European soccer season.

April will give us our Champions League semifinalists and some lower-division domestic cup finalists. It will likely provide us champions in the Spanish, German, Italian and French title races. It might also provide some clarity in the epic three-way Premier League title fight between Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City, not to mention races for Champions League spots and relegation.

It's time to once again set the table. Competition by competition, here are the five or so biggest matches of a particularly huge month.

April 11 & 18: Bayer Leverkusen vs. West Ham (Europa League)

It's like there was a seeding error. If you list the Champions League quarterfinalists by their current ClubElo.com rankings, you get No. 1 Manchester City, No. 2 Real Madrid, No. 5 Arsenal, No. 6 Bayern, No. 8 PSG, No. 9 Barcelona, No. 11 Borussia Dortmund and No. 14 Atletico. Those are also the quarterfinal pairings. The two best teams play each other in the quarters, along with the next two best, et cetera, and the top four teams are in the same half of the draw. That will assure us of an upstart finalist -- or whatever qualifies as an upstart these days in European soccer -- and it will also assure that the most high-quality matchups of the knockout rounds happen in the quarterfinals.

So be it. City vs. Real Madrid will give us all the raw technical talent and tactical contrast we could want. Arsenal vs. Bayern will be a fascinating battle between a pragmatic Gunners team looking for its first Champions League semifinal in 15 years and a Bayern team that wins the xG battle about as well as ever but is, um, cursed. PSG vs. Barca gives us two hot teams and an excuse to have ""La Remontada"" flashbacks. BVB vs. Atletico will give us two demonstrative home environments and a clear semifinal underdog.

Meanwhile, in the Europa League, we get the latest episode of Will Bayer Leverkusen Ever Lose? Late heroics have become a habit of late, and a treble remains on the table for Xabi Alonso's squad.

Both the oddsmakers and Pep Guardiola agree: Liverpool, with a two-point lead over Arsenal and a three-point lead over Man City, are the Premier League title favorites at the moment. But the Opta power rankings say City are still the best team in the world, and since the start of 2024, Arsenal have comfortably been the best team.

Past three months:

- Arsenal: 2.78 points per game, +1.88 xG differential per match

- Liverpool: 2.50 PPG, +1.56 xGD

- Manchester City: 2.40 PPG, +1.07 xGD

The Gunners even took four points in head-to-head matches against the two this year as well, with City managing two and Liverpool just one.

In other words, with just nine matches to go in the race, you can still see whatever you want. Whoever you think is the favorite, you've got solid logic on your side. The three teams are done playing each other, but between Liverpool visiting Old Trafford (where the Reds lost in the FA Cup just a couple of weeks ago), Arsenal playing both fourth-place Villa and fifth-place Spurs, and City welcoming Villa as well, there are still plenty of opportunities for plot twists. Meanwhile, on the weekend of April 21, we've got one of many opportunities for a lower-division team (Haji Wright's Coventry City, in this case) to make a cup final.",espn.com,2024-04-02T17:44:05.000000Z,https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/39858684/uefa-champions-league-premier-league-fa-cup-laliga-bundesliga-serie-women-super-league-euro-2024-copa-america-april-schedule-watch,0.75

- Arsenal: 2.78 points per game, +1.88 xG differential per match

- Liverpool: 2.50 PPG, +1.56 xGD

- Manchester City: 2.40 PPG, +1.07 xGD

The Gunners even took four points in head-to-head matches against the two this year as well, with City managing two and Liverpool just one.

In other words, with just nine matches to go in the race, you can still see whatever you want. Whoever you think is the favorite, you've got solid logic on your side. The three teams are done playing each other, but between Liverpool visiting Old Trafford (where the Reds lost in the FA Cup just a couple of weeks ago), Arsenal playing both fourth-place Villa and fifth-place Spurs, and City welcoming Villa as well, there are still plenty of opportunities for plot twists. Meanwhile, on the weekend of April 21, we've got one of many opportunities for a lower-division team (Haji Wright's Coventry City, in this case) to make a cup final.",espn.co.uk,2024-04-02T22:44:06.000000Z,https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/39858684/uefa-champions-league-premier-league-fa-cup-laliga-bundesliga-serie-women-super-league-euro-2024-copa-america-april-schedule-watch,0.75
bf1454e6-e6fc-4a71-af9d-84d35f78fecd,Barcelona complete quadruple with victory in women's Champions League final,"AITANA BONMATI AND Alexia Putellas struck to earn Barcelona their third women’s Champions League trophy, securing a 2-0 triumph over record eight-time winners Lyon on Saturday.

The defending champions had never beaten the French giants, losing in the 2019 and 2022 finals against them, but finally succeeded in Bilbao to compete a spectacular quadruple this season in coach Jonatan Giraldez’s last match in charge.

Bonmati pounced after 63 minutes and substitute Putellas finished the job in stoppage time to avenge Barcelona’s prior defeats by Sonia Bompastor’s side.

Securing their third Champions League trophy from five final appearances across the last six seasons, Barcelona demonstrated that they are the new powerhouse of the women’s game.

Barca stars insisted this time they were capable of beating Lyon, adding experience and mental strength to their undoubted talent, and so it proved at a packed San Mames.

Backed by the vast majority of a 51,000 record crowd at a women’s Champions League final, Bonmati and her side completed one of the few outstanding challenges remaining to them.

“It’s the first time we’ve beaten Lyon, I’m proud of the team, and we know that with these fans we have, we can’t fail,” Bonmati told DAZN.

“It’s incredible what we’re living through as a team, I’m so lucky… to see we’re creating that for so many people, the historic amount of fans we’ve brought, it’s the proudest I’ve felt, I wouldn’t change it for anything.”

Giraldez started Mariona Caldentey in attack and moved Fridolina Rolfo to left-back, dropping Ona Batlle to the bench alongside two-time Ballon d’Or winner Putellas.

Lyon left Ada Hegerberg on the bench too, with the all-time top scorer in the competition’s history struggling for form after injury.

Lucy Bronze deflected a ball onto her own crossbar and Lyon’s towering captain Wendie Renard hit the outside of the post as Barcelona suffered a couple of early jitters.

After going four goals down by half-time in the 2019 final and three down in 2022, this time the Catalans dug deep to hold it together at the back.

Barca threatened increasingly at the other end. Patri Guijarro, who scored twice in last year’s final against Wolfsburg, broke in behind for their first big chance after half an hour.

Christiane Endler saved her effort from an angle and Selma Bacha cleared the ball off the line after it rebounded back towards goal.

Caroline Graham Hansen, in sparkling form this season, gave left-back Bacha a torrid time and had 11-time finalist Renard uncertainly backpedalling fearfully near the end of the first half, but dragged her shot wide.

Barcelona made their quality count after the hour mark when Bonmati sent them ahead.

The Ballon d’Or winner had been quiet but arrived just at the right time to collect Caldentey’s clever pass and burst into the area.

Bonmati’s low shot deflected off Vanessa Gilles and flew over the helpless Endler, for her sixth goal of the tournament and the most crucial.

Champions League top goalscorer Kadidiatou Diani curled agonisingly over for Lyon as Bompastor’s side tried to fight back. Hegerberg headed off target as Lyon’s chances ebbed away.

Eventually Putellas, on as a late substitute, put on the captain’s armband and settled the game by rifling into the top corner to get Barcelona’s celebrations started early.

Jude Bellingham is 20 years old. He has just been named LaLiga's player of the year after scoring 19 goals to fire Real Madrid to the league title in his debut season at arguably the world's biggest club. On Saturday, he'll play a Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium, before flying off to star for England at this summer's European Championships.

It's a dizzying trajectory, ticking off a lifelong checklist of career aspirations in just a few months. Surely even Bellingham -- whose quiet self-confidence and steely ambition come across in every performance on the field, and every public appearance off it -- couldn't have expected to achieve quite so much, so soon?

""Yeah, I've got to be honest, probably, yeah,"" he said, smiling, speaking to a small group of journalists at Madrid's training ground on Monday, five days before the biggest game of his career to date. ""I always thought I could reach this level. This was always the level I wanted to play at. I probably never realized it would happen so quickly.""

It's Bellingham's first Champions League final. His coach, Carlo Ancelotti, has been involved in nine -- three as a player, six as a coach -- over 40 years. Ancelotti knows the importance of savouring the buildup to a game like this. ""It's a week to enjoy,"" Ancelotti said on Monday. ""Until the day of the final, we'll enjoy the moment ... Then, the worry arrives. The fear, the cold sweat arrives on Saturday afternoon, that's normal.""

Bellingham doesn't need reminding. ""I'm really excited,"" he said. ""It's a game I've been dreaming of since I started playing football. I understand the opportunity, I understand not many people get to play in games like this, and I don't want to waste a second. I want to take in the whole week. I want to take in the experience of the game, and try to enjoy it. ... It would be stupid now to get here and want to hide away from the occasion.""

If the prospect of winning club football's biggest prize weren't enough, Madrid's opponents on Saturday are Dortmund, the club that took a chance on Bellingham in 2020, signing him from Birmingham City as a 17-year-old and helping him grow as a player before his move to Madrid last summer.

""It's definitely special,"" Bellingham said on Monday. ""But the preparation has to be the same as for every game. I know what makes me feel good going into a game, I've had experience of playing with some amazing pros, and I've always stolen little things from them. It's important to just be me going into the game, and try not to worry too much about the emotional side.""

play 2:47 Robson: Dortmund need discipline to defend Real Madrid Stewart Robson breaks down how Borussia Dortmund need to improve their discipline in defence to keep out Real Madrid in the Champions League final.

A year at Madrid has seen Bellingham go from outstanding teenage prospect to global superstar, helped by a club record-breaking start to the season that saw him rack up 13 goals in 13 games. Long before the LaLiga title, individual awards were already heading his way -- the 2024 Kopa Trophy for best under-21 player, Tuttosport's 2024 Golden Boy award, the Laureus World Breakthrough Award -- with talk of being a contender for the 2024 Ballon d'Or.

It started with a tactical switch, Ancelotti boldly picking Bellingham in a more attacking role to compensate for Madrid's lack of a world-class centre-forward after the departure of Karim Benzema.

""It was from the first day,"" Bellingham said on Monday. ""He [Ancelotti] said I was going to be playing a little bit higher. It's not something I'd done consistently before, but I was really excited by the prospect: being close to goal, being a bit more free in that top third. In the end it was a decent decision. He [Ancelotti] knows what he's doing!""

Bellingham's second half of the season has been more discreet. A shoulder injury -- dislocated in November, protected with strapping since -- and an ankle problem picked up in February have affected his form. Ancelotti adjusted Bellingham's position in the team, dropping him deeper and to the left, requiring more defensive off-the-ball work. Bellingham's goal-scoring rate was reduced to that of a more typical midfielder, with six goals in 12 LaLiga games in 2024.

In the Champions League, four goals in his first four group games -- against Union Berlin, Braga and twice against Napoli -- have been followed by six matches without scoring, including both legs against Manchester City and Bayern Munich. In those four quarterfinal and semifinal games, Bellingham's combined xG (expected goals) was 0.12 from just three shots, in 374 minutes played.

His most notable knockout stage contribution -- a vital one -- came with the team underperforming and under pressure in the home leg against RB Leipzig in the round of 16, carrying the ball half the length of the pitch before splitting the Leipzig defence with an assist for Vinicius Junior. The move showcased Bellingham's strengths in a deeper role, his speed in transition and eye for a pass.

Against City and Bayern he was more subdued, his individual displays reflective of the team's struggle to consistently impose itself in those ties. In the 3-3 home draw with Manchester City on April 9, Bellingham had 48 touches, fewer than any City player except Erling Haaland. In the 2-2 draw at Bayern Munich on April 30, he was substituted, tiring, on 75 minutes, replaced by Luka Modric with the team 2-1 down.

Ancelotti has said Bellingham is ""doing his job"" -- ""the goals have dropped off a bit, but the performance hasn't,"" he said in April -- and the team has kept on winning.

Madrid clinched LaLiga with four games to spare, and in London, they can make it a league and Champions League double, Madrid's second in three years. Before the match, you'll see Bellingham out on the Wembley pitch, walking alone, visualizing key moments in the game, a ritual he has followed all season.

""It's a belief that my family's always given me,"" Bellingham said on Monday. ""Teammates I've had, staff members I've had from the [Birmingham] academy. I've always thought to dream as big as possible. It's a feeling I've always had growing up. I've worked hard, but there's a lot of luck involved as well. I don't shy away from saying how fortunate I've been.

The stage is now set for a very exciting performance.

Where and when is the 2024-2025 Champions League final?

The grand final will be played on May 31, 2025, in Munich, Germany. The stage that will host the meeting will be the Allianz Arena, which has a capacity for 70,000 spectators and is home to Bayern Munich. What a place to be what for. The arena is something to truly behold.

The stadium was inaugurated on June 2, 2005, and hosted the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. The final has an end goal, and so. What will be the all time highest level of success with this?

Past finals in Munich

The 2025 final will be the second final to be played at the Allianz Arena. In 2012, the local Bayern lost to Chelsea on penalties. It was the London team’s first title in the Champions League.

The city of Munich had already been the venue on three other occasions. The chosen venue was the Olympic Stadium in Munich, also the venue for the 1974 World Cup final. It has had a long, big time, history with people and the soccer game.

In 1979 Nottingham Forest defeated Malmö 1-0; in 1993 Olympique Marseille beat AC Milan, and in 1997 Borussia Dortmund beat Juventus. There were three stories on their own and what a new way would it be known with them? Then in show? And May with know with new!!!

00d54ef4-6988-4d07-b77e-98bb9de63978,Ancelotti faces goalkeeper dilemma ahead of Champions League final. Courtois or Lunin?,"Hey there, time traveller!

This article was published 10/05/2024 (366 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti will give Thibaut Courtois another chance to impress before deciding which of his goalkeepers will start the Champions League final.

While, Courtois is considered one of the world’s top goalkeepers, he has just recently returned from a long-term injury. In his absence, backup Andriy Lunin helped take the team to the June 1 final against Borussia Dortmund.

Ancelotti said Friday he plans to give Courtois more playing time in the league to assess his form, but that he had one month “to think about it.”

Lunin was a rarely used backup to Courtois until the Belgian ruptured a left-knee ligament in August just two days before the start of the season. The Ukrainian took over the staring job and has impressed in his place.

Courtois had been sidelined until he started last weekend’s 3-0 win over Cadiz, a victory that secured Madrid’s 36th Spanish league title.

But Lunin was back in the net for Wednesday’s 2-1 win over Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinals.

Ancelotti said Friday that Courtois will play on Saturday when Madrid visits Granada in the league. He said he would rest several starters, including Jude Bellingham, for a game that has no implications for Madrid. Granada is in 19th place and struggling to avoid relegation.

After Granada, Madrid will have three more Spanish league games before the big final in London.

“Courtois will play tomorrow,” Ancelotti said. “I have these (remaining) games to evaluate the goalkeepers.”

Lunin consolidated himself as Ancelotti’s first-choice keeper even after Madrid brought in Kepa Arrizabalaga following the injury to Courtois. The 25-year-old Ukrainian saved two penalties in the decisive shootout win over Manchester City in the quarterfinals.

Courtois, however, has proven experience in finals. The 31-year-old Belgian won the 2022 Champions League with Madrid, the FA Cup with Chelsea, the Europa League with Atletico Madrid, and two Copa del Rey titles (one for Madrid, one for Atletico), among several other titles.

Former Madrid and Spain goalie Iker Casillas weighed in, saying that for him Lunin should stay in goal against Dortmund.

“Lunin has shown he has sure hands in goal and can rise to the moment,” Casillas said, while questioning whether Courtois would have enough time to regain his top form for the final.

“I completely respect what a Madrid legend says, but I don’t want to get into this debate because I have this month to think about it,” Ancelotti said when asked about Casillas’ opinion.

TCHOUAMENI DOUBTFUL

Ancelotti may have to find a replacement for holding midfielder Aurélien Tchouameni for the final after he was diagnosed with a left-foot injury.

“We have doubts about Tchouameni being able to play the final,” Ancelotti said.

If the France midfielder does not recover, then his spot would likely go to countryman Eduardo Camavinga.

Barcelona’s return to the Champions League final will have to wait.

After erasing an Inter Milan lead on Tuesday for the third time across the two-legged semifinals, Barça took its first lead of the total-goals-wins series and then almost immediately squandered it, conceding twice more to the hosts in Milan’s famed San Siro Stadium and losing in extra time 4-3 and 7-6 on aggregate.

Still, it’s hard to say that Inter didn’t deserve its victory. The Nerazzurri were unlucky not to leave Spain with a win in last week’s opener, but the 3-3 tie in Barcelona meant all they had to do was win Tuesday’s rematch — Inter went into the decisive contest having never lost a Champions League semi at home — to return to the biggest stage in global club soccer for the second time in three seasons.

Here’s how Tuesday’s epic semifinal second leg shook out.

Play of the game

Barcelona had one foot in the final in second-half stoppage time as they nursed a 3-2 lead in the game and a 6-5 advantage overall. Inter center back Francesco Acerbi had other ideas. With three of the five minutes of second-half stoppage time in the books and Barça’s bench ready to run onto the field in celebration, Acerbi saved his side when he raced forward and poked home the equalizer from the doorstep following a square pass from Denzel Dumfries:

Turning point

The final twist of this roller-coaster home-and-home didn’t arrive until the 189th minute of the series. That’s when Inter’s Davide Frattesi scored the 13th and decisive goal of the two legs to send the defending Italian champions into the final.

Key stat

When Raphinha put Barça ahead on Tuesday with just three minutes of regular time remaining, it marked the first time they had led over the two games. It didn’t last long — Acerbi’s leveler came just six minutes later, swinging the momentum again and sending the match to extra time.

What’s next for Barcelona?

Barça has only itself to blame for falling behind twice and settling for the 3-3 tie in front of its home supporters in last week’s first leg in Catalonia. But despite not reaching the European final for the first time in a decade, the club took a clear step forward this season under German manager Hans Flick. This was Barça's first semifinal appearance since 2019. The Blaugrana are also in pole position to win Spain’s La Liga, leading rivals Real Madrid by four points with four league matches left to play.

The first of those comes on Sunday against — who else? — Los Blancos, who would love nothing more than to beat Barça for the first time in 2024-25.

What’s next for Inter Milan?

The Nerazzurri are headed back to the biggest match in the club game for the second time since 2023. Inter, which narrowly lost to Manchester City in Istanbul two years ago despite registering twice as many shots as the victors, will face either Arsenal or Paris Saint-Germain in the May 31 final in Munich. PSG leads the Gunners 1-0 on aggregate heading into Wednesday’s decider at the Parc des Princes.

bcd02aef-aad6-42a7-b2d2-a1ac008b1589,"Final derby at Goodison, trip to City & Champions League draw","Liverpool have yet another busy month to navigate and one that will tell us plenty about their silverware hopes for 2024/25, with a possible seven games across three competitions.

Arne Slot‘s side experienced a few blips in January, losing twice and drawing once across in nine games across all competitions – though they remain top of the Premier League and Champions League.

There was progression in the FA Cup, but the Reds do have a deficit to overturn if they are to send us to Wembley for yet another Carabao Cup final.

The deciding leg is one match in another busy month that will be full of nerves for those of us watching on.

February 6 – Tottenham (H)

February starts with the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg, and there is a one-goal deficit to overturn at Anfield against a side who are consistently inconsistent.

Spurs have been decimated by injury this season but have started to welcome back a few faces ahead of the decider – which will give them a boost as they continue to languish 14th in the league table.

There is no guarantee, but Liverpool ought to feel comfortable getting the job done.

February 9 – Plymouth (A)

Rotation will then again be on the cards for yet another trip to the south coast, this time to meet Championship cellar dwellers Plymouth in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

They sit 24th in the Championship with 25 points and recently sold one of their joint-top goalscorers, making this a valuable chance to give more minutes to those on the fringe.

We would not be surprised to see a team that is not too dissimilar to the one that faced PSV in the Champions League.

February 12 – Everton (A)

The final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park then awaits, which is our game in hand after the initial fixture was postponed due to Storm Darragh in early December.

An evening kickoff will only lift the atmosphere, one that has already been boosted by the return of David Moyes and three successive victories in the league – trust us to have to play them now!

This is a huge fixture and one that would establish a nine-point gap at the top after 24 games.

February 16 – Wolves (H)

The fixture list does not relent, as days later the Reds will welcome Wolves to Anfield – this time with a different manager to whom they faced in the reverse fixture in September.

Gary O’Neil was replaced by Vitor Pereira in December and he has since overseen four wins from nine games (at the time of writing), still leaving them in the mix for relegation.

This is the second of only three home fixtures this month.

February 19 – Aston Villa (A) *

This fixture is not yet locked in for this date as it all rests on if Liverpool progress to the Carabao Cup final.

If Slot’s side secure their place at Wembley, they lose a free midweek as this league fixture needs to be moved from the weekend of the final (March 15/16) to the only guaranteed free spot in the schedule.

However, if Liverpool do not overturn their deficit to Tottenham, this match will be played on March 15. The joys of being successful in so many competitions, eh!

February 21 – Champions League last 16 draw

This is when Liverpool will discover who they will meet in the last 16 of the Champions League, in addition to their possible path to the final as the bracket will be finalised.

Slot’s side will meet either the winner of Brest vs. PSG OR Monaco vs. Benfica – though, we already know the Reds will host the second leg at Anfield.

Not as many unknowns in this new format but at least we can look ahead to who our potential opponents could be in the quarter-final and semi-final.

The ties will be played on March 4/5 and 11/12.

February 23 – Man City (A)

This fixture is not quite the blockbuster as it was anticipated to be considering City’s downfall, but it remains a vital hurdle for Liverpool to clear.

They have not won at the Etihad in the league since 2015 and it is about time that changed, for everyone’s sanity. Three points would be hugely significant in the race for the title.

Notably, City will have travelled to Real Madrid less than four days before this match.

February 26 – Newcastle (H)

To close out the month, Eddie Howe’s Newcastle make the trip to Anfield just days after the battle at City in a late midweek kickoff (8.15pm GMT).

The reverse fixture felt chaotic, to say the least, as Liverpool were just minutes away from a successful comeback win before a late mistake saw the points shared.

Newcastle are battling for a European spot this season and they cannot be another who leave Merseyside with points, not when only six more league home games remain after this one.

88c687e6-0247-49a7-bafd-4d19da9fdda0,Olympiakos rises into next Champions League and skips qualifying rounds after PSG reaches final,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek league winner Olympiakos will return to the Champions League next season after a five-year gap because Paris Saint-Germain advanced to the final late Wednesday.

“We are back!” the new Greek champion posted Thursday on its social media accounts after its elevated status was confirmed by UEFA.

PSG’s win over Arsenal in the semifinals means it will play Inter Milan in the May 31 final in Munich. Both finalists already qualified for the next Champions League through their national league position so the entry reserved for the defending champion can be reallocated.

That guaranteed place in the 36-team league format goes to the national champion in the qualifying rounds that has the best UEFA ranking, based on European competition results over a five-year period.

Olympiakos has that high ranking — currently No. 37 in all Europe — fueled by winning the Conference League title last year, as the first Greek team to win a European trophy.

The champion of Greece had been set to enter the 2025-26 Champions League qualifying rounds in July, needing to advance through three rounds to reach the lucrative league phase.

Olympiakos sealed the Greek league title, the 48th in its history, last weekend and now avoids having to beat three opponents to reach the elite Champions League stage.

The team, owned by shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis, last played in the Champions League in 2020-21, placing third in a group behind Manchester City and Porto.

In recent years, UEFA has adopted the habit of turning sports into a global spectacle, in the ""American way"", and the Champions League final on May 31, one of the most followed football games of the year, will have a special music show by American rock band Linkin Park.

The band released today a preview of what they will bring to the ""UEFA Champions League Final Kick Off Show by Pepsi"" (sic): a remix of the band's old riffs (like Numb) with ""the sights and sounds of the UEFA Champions League"". Oh boy.

Linkin Park rose to prominence in the early 2000s as an alternative rock band lead by vocalist Chester Bennington, who died by suicide in 2017. But in 2024, the band returned with new vocalist Emily Armstrong, releasing their first album since 2017, From Zero, and kicking off an ongoing worldwide tour.

48a110a3-385c-4613-ad9d-abc5e81250b1,Luka Modrić wins 6th Champions League title,"Croatia captain Luka Modrić has won his 6th UEFA Champions League title after Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in the final at Wembley tonight.

Modrić, who came on in the 84th minute, won his first Champions League title with Real Madrid in 2014, went on to win it also in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022 and now in 2024.

Modrić now with 6 titles is the most any player has achieved in the game. Dani Carvajal, Toni Kroos and Nacho also has won the same number and joined Real legend Paco Gento with six titles.

Tonight was also the 13th year in row a Croatian has featured in the final of European football’s pinnacle prize.

Ivica Olić, current assistant coach of Croatia, started the incredible run of Croatians in the Champions League Final way back in 2012. Since then, every year a team in the final has had a Croatian in the squad.

Mario Mandžukic scored in the final against Borussia Dortmund to help Bayern Munich secure the title back in 2013.

The following season Luka Modrić won his first Champions League with Real Madrid, followed by Ivan Rakitić with Barcelona the next season. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, Modrić and Kovačić claimed the trophy with Real Madrid.

a812c4b7-c6c7-47d3-9f16-0dcdec6b960f,'Always believe': Underdogs Dortmund aim to shock Real Madrid in Champions League final,"Dortmund's Dutch forward #21 Donyell Malen (L), Dortmund's English forward #43 Jamie Bynoe-Gittens (C) and Dortmund's German forward #14 Niclas Fuellkrug take part in a training session at Wembley stadium, London, May 31, 2024, on the eve of their UEFA Champions League final football match against Real Madrid.

The star-studded Spanish giants are heavy favourites to be crowned European champions for the 15th time, and a sixth in the last 11 seasons, against a Dortmund team that have beaten the odds just to make it to the English capital.

Madrid have lost just twice in 54 games in all competitions this season, storming to the title in La Liga by 10 points and thrashing Barcelona 4-1 to lift the Spanish Super Cup along the way.

However, they have had to once again dig deep to reach what coach Carlo Ancelotti described as the ""biggest game of any season"" in the Champions League.

Ancelotti's men withstood a barrage from defending champions Manchester City to win their quarter-final tie on penalties before another legendary late fightback at the Santiago Bernabeu to beat Bayern Munich in the last four.

""We never stop believing, no matter how the circumstances are,"" said Luka Modric, who along with Nacho, Dani Carvajal and Toni Kroos, in the final match of his club career, can win the European Cup for a record-equalling sixth time as a player.

""We always believe, keep believing, keep pushing, fighting until the end. In the end, we manage to find a way to beat opponents.

""Many people say there is luck, but when it happens so many times, I think it's not just luck.""

Madrid's Bellingham moulded by Dortmund

The career path of Jude Bellingham exemplifies the scale of the task facing Dortmund.

Plucked from English Championship side Birmingham as a teenager, he was moulded and developed by the German giants before being picked off by Madrid for a transfer fee in excess of 100 million euros ($109 million) 12 months ago.

Without him, Dortmund struggled domestically this season, finishing fifth in the Bundesliga, 27 points adrift of Bayer Leverkusen.

Yet, Terzic's men have saved their best for the Champions League stage to reach the final for the third time in the club's history and first since they lost at Wembley to Bayern Munich 11 years ago.

Dortmund topped the group of death featuring Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Newcastle.

PSV Eindhoven and Atletico Madrid were then seen off before a heroic defensive display kept out PSG over two legs in the semi-finals.

""They are the favourites but we don't care, we haven't been the favourites against Atletico or against PSG,"" said Terzic.

""But if we are brave and not here to watch Real Madrid lift the trophy, if we are here to give them a game, then we have a chance.""

In stark contrast to Madrid's moniker as the kings of the competition, Dortmund's only previous Champions League success came back in 1997.

Over 100,000 fans of the German giants are estimated to have made the trip to London despite the club being allocated just 30,000 tickets.

Marco Reus is one of only two Dortmund players who were in the side that lost to Bayern at Wembley 11 years ago and is dreaming of the perfect end to his time at the club.

Saturday will be the 429th and final game of Reus' Dortmund career that could have a fairytale ending.

""I would say there is nothing better than playing your last game in a Champions League final and winning it,"" said Reus, who turned 35 on Friday.

""Now the objective is to win the trophy because we cannot imagine how things could be the very next day in Dortmund.""

UEFA will be hoping the focus is on the protagonists on the field come full-time to ensure their decision to return to Wembley for a major final is not questioned.

Three years ago, the final of Euro 2020 was marred by violence as ticketless fans stormed the stadium doors to gain entry.

The English Football Association have invested £5 million ($6 million) into improving safety and infrastructure at Wembley, which is also set to host the Euro 2028 final.

e5aed295-3892-4ac8-ab5c-2d0624f8f8e7,How much will Inter Milan earn for reaching the UEFA Champions League Final after beating Barcelona?,"Inter Milan have officially punched their ticket to the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League Final after a dramatic 4–3 extra-time win over FC Barcelona at San Siro in the second leg of the semifinals. Along with the prestige of reaching the final, the Italian giants are set to cash in on a major financial reward.

Much like in the first leg, Inter started strong and jumped out to a two-goal lead. Lautaro Martínez opened the scoring in the 21st minute and later won a penalty that Hakan Çalhanoğlu converted just before halftime. Barcelona mounted a fierce response, turning the scoreline to 3–2 in their favor. But Francesco Acerbi came to Inter’s rescue with a 93rd-minute equalizer to send the tie to extra time.

Substitute Davide Frattesi became the hero in the 99th minute, sealing a 4–3 win on the night and a 7–6 aggregate victory. The win not only earned Inter a spot in the Champions League Final—it also guaranteed a significant financial windfall.

Inter’s prize money for reaching the Champions League Final

The revamped Champions League format, which now includes more teams and matches in an already packed schedule, has also increased the total prize pool. Inter have already pocketed a substantial amount during their journey to the final.

By simply participating in the tournament, every club received a base fee of €18.6 million. In the league phase, where each win is worth €2.1 million and each draw €700,000, Inter recorded six wins, one draw, and one loss—accumulating €13.3 million.

Their qualification to the knockout stage added another €13 million (€11M for reaching the round of 16 and €2M via playoff qualification). Victories over Feyenoord, Bayern Munich, and Barcelona in the knockout rounds earned them €12.5 million, €15 million, and €18.5 million, respectively.

In total, Inter Milan have secured approximately €72.3 million in prize money just from their results on the field—excluding revenue from sponsorships and broadcasting rights.

More money on the line in the final

Inter will now await the winner of the PSG vs. Arsenal semifinal to see who they’ll face in the final, scheduled for May 31. A victory in the title match would bring in an additional €6.5 million, and a further €4 million for participating in the UEFA Super Cup. Altogether, a Champions League title would represent a financial windfall of nearly €83 million in one season—providing a massive boost for Inter Milan on and off the pitch.

Germany is witnessing a rise in hotel bookings as the country gears up to host the UEFA Champions League final on 31 May. According to data from SiteMinder, the world’s leading hotel distribution and revenue platform, reservations at local hotels between 29-31 May are currently higher by 32% compared to bookings made over the same period last year.

SiteMinder’s data further reveals that room rates have increased year-on-year in the lead-up to the final at Munich’s Allianz Arena, with the average daily rate (ADR) for stays during the period climbing by 10% to €265, from €241 last year. By contrast, the ADR in the preceding week was €56 lower, highlighting the spike in demand as the final game approaches.

Additionally, shifts in booking windows and lengths of stay reflect the impact of one of the world’s most anticipated football matches: travellers are locking in their stays at local properties earlier by 23 days, with the average booking lead time reaching 136 days, up from 113 days last year. Meanwhile, stays have shortened slightly year-on-year, with guests booking for an average of 1.57 nights, down from 1.83 nights over the same period in 2024.

“We saw during Germany’s hosting of UEFA Euros last year just how positive its impact was on local hotels, and it’s pleasing to see that the Champions League is proving no different, offering valuable momentum at a time when hotels are navigating more complex market dynamics,” says Andreas Kastl, SiteMinder’s Regional Manager – DACH. “With thousands of fans – both local and international – preparing to travel to Germany to see who takes home this year’s trophy, hotels are encouraged to fully embrace dynamic revenue practices that respond quickly to booking demand, whether through pricing or marketing strategies. For instance, longer booking windows give hotels more time to connect with their guests, creating opportunities to upsell and provide exclusive, personalised offers well before visiting fans arrive at the front desk.”

Ahead of the final showdown in Munich, the UEFA Champions League semi-finals will be played over two legs on 29-30 April and 6-7 May, with each of the qualifying teams set to host one match at their respective home stadiums across Europe. The venues will be confirmed following the quarter-final results.

e9df46c9-6bd9-4ee4-b554-ed5b27d86f1f,Mbappe and PSG have sights on Champions League final but Dortmund stand in way,"DORTMUND: The tantalising prospect of Kylian Mbappe squaring up to Real Madrid in the Champions League final looms large, with only Borussia Dortmund lying in Paris St Germain’s way.

Mbappe becomes a free agent at the end of the season when Real are favourites to finally land the forward they have coveted for so long.

Before that there are trophies to be won, with none bigger in club football than the Champions League.

Real, who face Bayern Munich in the other semi-final, have dominated the competition with 14 wins, while PSG and Mbappe are still waiting for their first.

Mbappe’s imminent departure has partly been attributed to PSG’s failure to transfer their domestic dominance to the continent. How ironic then if the France forward triumphed in his final year at the club, especially against the team he looks likeliest to join.

Conversely, a record-extending 15th crown for Madrid at the expense of PSG would serve only to confirm to Mbappe that his ambitions are best served at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.

But before that, while Real have to do their bit, Mbappe and PSG too have their work cut out with a trip to Dortmund for Wednesday’s first leg.

PSG won another Ligue 1 title on Sunday but the Champions League is the trophy the Qatar-backed club is desperate to finally get its hands on. PSG lost the final in 2020 to Bayern Munich.

The club is already planning for life without superstar striker Mbappe with players like Randal Kolo Muani, Ousmane Dembele and Goncalo Ramos expected to help fill the void in his absence.

But Mbappe could still have a big say in the Champions League and he scored two goals in PSG’s 4-1 comeback win against Barcelona in the quarter-finals.

“It’s the question you hear the most: ‘How do you stop Kylian Mbappe?’” Dortmund coach Edin Terzic told reporters on Tuesday. “With his exceptional individual quality, he [Mbappe] has now scored 43 goals in 44 games. Opponents set themselves the goal of not letting him score in 44 games. It doesn’t always work.

“But if you focus only on Kylian Mbappe, then comes Ousmane Dembele or [Goncalo] Ramos, or Vitinha, or [Achraf] Hakimi, or (Randal) Kolo Muani and all the others. They have unbelievable quality. If we want to focus on one thing, then we need to focus on the ball. If we worry about the ball — there’s just one — then it’s much harder for them to score.”

Terzic said lifting the European Cup has been the “main objective” of PSG since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments.

“The project in Paris began with the goal of winning the Champions League,” Terzic said. “That’s been their main objective for a decade. They have added a very, very high level of quality to this team, a team that has been built up in recent years to win the Champions League.”

It’s been a strange season for Dortmund and that was underlined by Saturday’s 4-1 Bundesliga loss against top-four rivals RB Leipzig.

Dortmund’s deep Champions League run this season, however, has kept fans hopeful of some silverware.

Dortmund, Champions League winners in 1997, also met PSG in the group stage. The French side won 2-0 in Paris before a 1-1 draw in Dortmund.

“You could sense in the return leg that we had learned the lessons from the first game,” Terzic said. “Now PSG look to be at their very peak this season with only one defeat in 2024 and a good run of results. We will have to show an improved performance from that in Dortmund.

“We are confident that will show it tomorrow and next week in Paris. The clear goal is to gain a small advantage after the game tomorrow. We know we have to play at least 180 minutes at the highest level to have any shot at our dream.”

Dortmund have gone 10 games unbeaten at home in the Champions League in their 80,000-seat strong Westfalenstadion fortress but PSG manager Luis Enrique, who won the elite European competition as Barcelona manager in 2015, dismissed talk his side were feeling the heat.

“What’s great about being here is that we can enjoy a really special game at a unique stadium in Europe,” the Spaniard, who took over at PSG at the end of last season, said on Tuesday.

“We have a chance to make our fans really happy by reaching the final. That’s what we’ve earned the right to do. We’ll try to enjoy that. We will try to win both legs. It’s not in our handbook to leave things to chance. It will be a wonderful spectacle for everyone who loves football.

“When you come to stadiums like this one it’s a pleasure. You have to enjoy where you are and where you are as footballers as well. We’ll experience it all tomorrow. We are ready and prepared to play two great games and want to win both of them.”

This article was published 24/05/2024 (352 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

BILBAO, Spain (AP) — Barcelona has to find a way past the most successful club in women’s soccer if it wants to build on its recent dominance.

Barcelona will play in its fourth straight Women’s Champions League final on Saturday in Bilbao against record eight-time champion Lyon, the nemesis it has never been able to beat.

The titleholder from Spain has a shot at a statement victory by finally overcoming the storied French club and winning its third European title — all within a four-season span.

Lyon, meanwhile, will be hoping to reclaim the trophy after not getting out of the quarterfinals last season and seeing the hype grow about Barcelona and its star players Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmatí, who have won back-to-back world player of the year awards.

“We are a team that has won a lot in the past. But we remain really ambitious,” Lyon coach Sonia Bompastor, the first woman to win the league as a player and coach, said on Friday.

“For me we are the best team in the world and will continue to be no matter what happens tomorrow. I trust my players. I know there is all the individual and collective talent needed to achieve this goal.”

Bompastor, who can become the first woman to win two titles as a coach, said it’s natural for rivals to be extra motivated to try to bring down Lyon, which will be playing in its 11th European final in 15 seasons.

Lyon won five titles in a row from 2016-20, and holds nearly every Women’s Champions League club record. The French side has won all four of its matches against Barcelona, including 4-1 in the 2019 final in Hungary and 3-1 in the 2022 final in Italy.

“This Barça is different from the one we faced in the final two years ago,” Bompastor said. “They have made new signings and each final brings with it a different story. It will be a totally different game tomorrow.”

Bonmatí said Barcelona has “grown a lot” since the first final against Lyon.

“I would say that we didn’t have any kind of experience, and physically, we were far off the big teams,” she said. “Now, we are probably one of the teams to beat out of anyone.”

Barcelona beat Chelsea for its first European title in 2021, and Wolfsburg for its second in 2023.

“We’ve had a fantastic season, playing great football, and the recent weeks have seen us on a great dynamic,” said Barcelona coach Jonatan Giráldez, who will leave at the end of the season to join U.S. club Washington Spirit. “It’ll be a great final because I have no doubt at all that these are the two best teams in the world right now. To have the chance to add another Champions League means we can try to show we are still the best team in Europe.”

The club had nine players in the Spain squad that broke through with the nation’s first Women’s World Cup title last year. Barcelona also sent eight players to the semifinals of the inaugural Women’s Nations League, which Spain won in February.

Barcelona is trying to become the third team to win three European titles, after the eight by Lyon and four by Eintracht Frankfurt. It reached the final by overcoming a 1-0 first-leg loss to Chelsea at home in the semifinals. Lyon eliminated French rival Paris Saint-Germain.

Lyon has lost two of its goal scorers from the 2022 final in Turin — Amandine Henry and Catarina Macario. The other, Ada Hegerberg, had been nursing a injury but was expected to be fit to play on Saturday.

SEOUL, April 16 (Yonhap) -- Two-time reigning South Korean champions Ulsan HD FC will battle Japanese side Yokohama F. Marinos this month for a spot in the final of the top Asian club football tournament.

The two teams will clash in the two-legged semifinals of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League, with Ulsan hosting the opening leg at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Munsu Football Stadium in Ulsan, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul. Yokohama will be the home team for the second leg at 7 p.m. on April 24.

Ulsan captured each of the past two K League 1 titles, while Yokohama were crowned the J1 League champions in 2022.

The winner of this South Korea-Japan showdown will meet the winner of the other semifinal matchup between Al Ain FC and Al Hilal.

Ulsan are in fine form heading into the opening leg, with their offense firing on all cylinders. In their most recent domestic match Saturday, Ulsan blanked Gangwon FC 4-0 behind a brace by Joo Min-kyu, the 2023 league scoring champion. Midfielder Lee Dong-gyeong had a goal and two assists to become the first player this season to be involved in 10 goals. He ranks second in the league with six goals and first with four assists.

Through seven matches, Ulsan lead all K League 1 clubs with 16 goals.

""This was the best match we've played this season,"" Ulsan head coach Hong Myung-bo said of Saturday's victory. ""And we have another important match coming up in the AFC Champions League. We will stay humble and prepare for the match the best we can.""

Joo, who has three goals in the AFC tournament, said, ""Our pride is on the line and we want to win this matchup for the rest of the K League.""

Ulsan's defense has also settled down after a rocky start, having posted consecutive clean-sheet victories.

Goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo, who stopped a penalty against Gangwon en route to his third clean sheet of the season, said he wants to make Ulsan supporters proud.

""We're confident we can win the first match because we'll be at home,"" Jo said. ""We want to prove that we are the best of the K League. We will give our fans much to cheer about when they come to see us play.""

Ulsan are also chasing a ticket to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

The revamped FIFA tournament will award the AFC four spots. Al Hilal and Urawa Red Diamonds, as the two most recent AFC Champions League winners, have grabbed two of them. The winner of the ongoing AFC Champions League will secure another spot, and the one remaining berth will go to the top team in the AFC club rankings, which are based on clubs' performances at the AFC Champions League in the 2021-2024 period.

Al Hilal are atop the rankings but they have already qualified for the Club World Cup. Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors of the K League 1, who lost to Ulsan in the quarterfinals of this year's Champions League, are in second place with 80 points. Ulsan, currently at 78 points, will move past Jeonbuk with a win in either of the legs in the semifinals.

A match victory and progress to the next stage of the AFC tournament are each worth three points, and a draw is good for one point.

Ulsan and Yokohama have some common connections.

Ulsan forward Yun Il-lok spent the 2018 season with Yokohama. Ulsan's physical trainer, Seigo Ikeda, worked for Yokohama from 1997 to 2007.

Yokohama's South Korean midfielder Nam Tae-hee is a product of Ulsan's youth clubs. Their Japanese midfielder Jun Amano played for Ulsan on loan in 2022.

Amano had a particularly ugly departure following his one-year stint with Ulsan. After Amano signed with Ulsan's chief rival Jeonbuk, Ulsan head coach Hong Myung-bo accused the midfielder of reneging on his earlier promise and chasing money, and even called Amano ""the worst Japanese player I've ever seen.""

One respected figure that connects these two clubs is the late South Korean international Yoo Sang-chul, who succumbed to cancer in 2021.

Yoo spent nine seasons with Ulsan across three stints, and played four seasons with Yokohama over two spells.

During those times, Yoo helped Ulsan grab K League titles in 1996 and 2005, and League Cup titles in 1995 and 1998. With Yoo in tow, Yokohama won back-to-back J1 League championships in 2003 and 2004.

Ulsan plan to hold a memorial event in honor of Yoo on the occasion of the match against Yokohama.

The K League club will invite visiting Yokohama supporters to pay their respects for Yoo at the late star's ""Wall of Memories"" set up inside Munsu Football Stadium. T-shirts and mufflers bearing Yoo's image from his playing days will be on sale.

Yokohama have agreed not to demand any royalty payments for the use of their club logo or other materials during the memorial event.

PARIS (AP) — Lyon will play Barcelona in the final of the Women’s Champions League after beating Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 in the semifinal second leg and 5-3 on aggregate.

Selma Bacha and Melchie Dumornay scored for the visitors on Sunday.

The May 25 final in Bilbao, northern Spain, will be a rematch of the 2019 and 2022 finals, both won by Lyon, the most successful club in the competition with eight titles.

Lyon is the only team still unbeaten in the Women’s Champions League this season.

“We’ve worked so hard this past year to get back to this point,” Lyon midfielder Lindsey Horan told broadcaster DAZN. “Obviously, coming off the last year and going into this season, we knew this was a goal of ours and a dream of ours again, and that’s the standard of this club and the level that we hold. I’m so proud of this team.”

In an all-French encounter, Lyon caught PSG off guard by playing a short corner in the third minute. Bacha cut inside to open the scoring with a low drive from the edge of the box.

Lyon nearly doubled the lead in the 34th but PSG goalkeeper Constance Picaud pulled off an outstanding save to prevent her teammate Jade Le Guilly from scoring an own-goal.

PSG capitalized on a Lyon turnover in midfield to equalize with an angled strike from Tabitha Chawinga into the far corner in the 41st.

Picaud kept PSG in the game by tipping a shot from France forward Kadidiatou Diani over the bar in the 43rd, denying Dumornay in the 52nd and parrying shots from Amel Majri and Dumornay in the 65th.

MADRID (AP) — After yet another magical night at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, Real Madrid is back in the Champions League final.

The 14-time European champion pulled off another thrilling comeback on Wednesday, rallying to defeat Bayern Munich 2-1 and reach the final for the second time in three seasons.

Like it happened so many times in 2022, Madrid needed some late drama to advance.

Joselu scored in the 88th minute and then in stoppage time as Madrid advanced 4-3 on aggregate to set up a final against Borussia Dortmund on June 1 in London.

“Well, it has happened again what has happened so many times before,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “It’s inexplicable. Fans who push us on, a fantastic stadium, players who never stop believing — it’s simply something magical.”

Bayern had taken the lead on an Alphonso Davies goal in the 68th — and then deep in stoppage time thought it had equalized but hadn’t because of an offside call that Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel described as “disastrous” and “against the rules.”

Joselu’s first goal was a tap in after Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer spilled an easy save. The second was initially called off for offside but was eventually allowed after video review.

“You always dream of being part of moments like this,” the 34-year-old Joselu said. “Not even my best dreams were as good as this.”

It will be Madrid’s record-extending 18th European Cup final, and ninth in the Champions League era, also a record. Madrid beat Liverpool when it last made it to the final in 2022, a season marked by several late comebacks like that one it pulled off on Wednesday.

Madrid at the time pulled off thrilling comebacks at the Bernabeu against Manchester City in the semifinals, Chelsea in the quarterfinals and Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16.

Six-time European champion Bayern was looking to return to the final for the first time since winning the competition in 2019-20. The loss meant there will be no rematch of the all-German final in 2013, when Bayern beat Dortmund to win its fifth European title.

“It hurts. It’ll take a while to recover, but on the one hand it’s a loss where we left it all out on the pitch,” Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel said. “Of course, it’s tough to accept. It’s part of reality. No regrets.”

Dortmund, the 1997 European champion, eliminated Paris Saint-Germain 2-0 on aggregate on Tuesday.

It was a mostly even match but Madrid created the most significant scoring chances. But it had not been able to get past what was a terrific performance by Neuer, who had made a series of difficult saves to keep Bayern in the match.

But the German international faltered in the final minutes, dropping an easy ball after a shot by Vinícius Júnior and allowing Joselu — who came off the bench in the 81st — to equalize from in front of the goal.

“Manu, who had been exceptional in saving us all night, made a mistake he wouldn’t make in another 100 years,” Tuchel said.

Neuer said “anyone who’s ever played football knows how I’m feeling right now.”

“That we’ve been knocked out in the closing stages, having led 1-0 until the 85th minute, it’s extremely bitter,” he said. “We’d taken one step to London, we saw ourselves in the final and now I’m lost for words.”

Joselu, a German-born striker, then gave Madrid the lead a minute into stoppage time after a cross by Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger off the left side.

The linesman initially raised the flag for offside, and it took a few moments before Madrid players and the crowd at the Bernabeu could celebrate the winner.

Bayern loudly complained at the end after a goal by Matthijs de Ligt didn’t count because the referee blew the whistle for offside without letting the play be completed.

De Ligt said the linesman apologized to him, saying he “made a mistake” for raising the flag without letting the play continue.

Davies, who had entered the match in the 27th to replace the injured Serge Gnabry, had given Bayern the lead by beating Rüdiger in a one-on-one situation, cutting back toward the middle of the area before firing a right-footed shot into the far corner past Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.

Madrid thought it had equalized a couple of minutes later but the goal was called off after video review because of a foul by defender Nacho Fernández on Joshua Kimmich.

The 2024-25 UEFA Champions League final is set.

Paris Saint-Germain defeated Arsenal 2-1 in Wednesday’s semifinal second leg to advance, 3-1 on aggregate, to Europe’s title match on May 31 against Inter Milan in Munich.

PSG, which won the first leg of the home-and-home, total-goals-wins series 1-0 last week at Emirates Stadium in London, doubled its advantage in the first half of the rematch at the Parc des Princes in France’s glittering capital.

Fabian Ruiz scored what turned out to be the series winner on a blistering volley 27 minutes into the Wednesday contest. Achraf Hakimi added another for the hosts in the second half before Bukayo Saka finally pulled one back for the Gunners. That was as close as Arsenal got, though.

Here’s how Wednesday’s action unfolded.

Play of the game

Ruiz’s strike marked the first career Champions League goal for the Spanish midfielder. For the 29-year-old, it was worth the wait:

ADVERTISEMENT

Turning point

Wednesday's result — and possibly the outcome of the series overall — could’ve been far different had PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma not made a pair of top-shelf saves shortly after kickoff.

Forced to chase the game following last week’s loss at home, Arsenal came out guns blazing in Paris. First, striker Gabriel Martinelli got on the end of a fourth-minute throw-in from Thomas Partey, only for Donnarumma to deny Martinelli’s left-footed shot from point-blank range.

Less than three minutes later, the 6-foot-5 Italian backstop made another all-world stop, this time on Martin Ødegaard’s goal-bound effort through traffic that Donnarumma somehow turned around his post:

Key stat

Need more proof that the numbers mean little in soccer? Consider that Arsenal dominated both the ball (the visitors had 55% of possession) and the shot share (19-11 overall) on Wednesday. Unfortunately for the Gunners, they were second-best when it came to the scoresheet — the only metric that actually matters.

What’s next for Arsenal?

They’ll have to wait at least another year to hoist a trophy.

After the Gunners trounced defending champion Real Madrid in the quarterfinals, the title felt very much in reach. Those hopes took a severe hit with last week’s loss, and sure enough that result came back to haunt Mikel Arteta’s side.

Still, Arsenal took another step forward this season, reaching the last four of the world’s top club competition for the first time since 2009. Arteta’s squad is also set to finish second in the Premier League for the third consecutive season; they’re four points clear of third-place Manchester City with three matches to go, starting with Saturday’s trip to champions Liverpool.

What’s next for Paris Saint-Germain?

Just the second trip to the Champions League final in club history. The last time PSG made it that far was five years ago, when they lost to Bayern Munich with superstars Kylian Mbappé and Neymar serving as the faces of the team.

Filled with hungry youngsters who have yet to become household names, the construction of Luis Enrique’s current squad is far different. But they play together. Winning it all won’t be easy. Inter, the runner-up to Man City two years ago, will have the clear experience edge at the Allianz Arena.

Yet after dispatching Liverpool in the round of 16 and then Arsenal in the semis, there’s no reason why the Parisians should fear the Nerazzurri. The bookies apparently agree: PSG is the early favorite to prevail. They’ve earned the right to play for that long-coveted European crown later this month, and only a fool would bet against them now.

According to data from SiteMinder, the world’s leading hotel distribution and revenue platform, reservations at local hotels between 29-31 May are currently higher by 32% compared to bookings made over the same period last year.

SiteMinder’s data further reveals that room rates have increased year-on-year in the lead-up to the final at Munich’s Allianz Arena, with the average daily rate (ADR) for stays during the period climbing by 10% to €265, from €241 last year. By contrast, the ADR in the preceding week was €56 lower, highlighting the spike in demand as the final game approaches.

Additionally, shifts in booking windows and lengths of stay reflect the impact of one of the world’s most anticipated football matches: travellers are locking in their stays at local properties earlier by 23 days, with the average booking lead time reaching 136 days, up from 113 days last year. Meanwhile, stays have shortened slightly year-on-year, with guests booking for an average of 1.57 nights, down from 1.83 nights over the same period in 2024.

We saw during Germany’s hosting of UEFA Euros last year just how positive its impact was on local hotels, and it’s pleasing to see that the Champions League is proving no different, offering valuable momentum at a time when hotels are navigating more complex market dynamics. With thousands of fans – both local and international – preparing to travel to Germany to see who takes home this year’s trophy, hotels are encouraged to fully embrace dynamic revenue practices that respond quickly to booking demand, whether through pricing or marketing strategies. For instance, longer booking windows give hotels more time to connect with their guests, creating opportunities to upsell and provide exclusive, personalised offers well before visiting fans arrive at the front desk. Andreas Kastl, SiteMinder’s Regional Manager – DACH

Ahead of the final showdown in Munich, the UEFA Champions League semi-finals will be played over two legs on 29-30 April and 6-7 May, with each of the qualifying teams set to host one match at their respective home stadiums across Europe. The venues will be confirmed following the quarter-final results.

e7c42b2f-c7a3-4ca6-bcfb-be70d7c3e0d9,Lion City Sailors lift Singapore league trophy under billionaire owner Forrest Li ahead of AFC Champions League Two final clash next weekend,"SINGAPORE, May 11 – The Lion City Sailors clinched the 2024-25 Singapore Premier League (SPL) title last night with a 1-0 victory over bottom-placed Tanjong Pagar, securing the trophy with two matches to spare.

Belgian winger Maxime Lestienne scored the decisive goal from the penalty spot in the first half, sealing the Sailors’ second league title under billionaire owner Forrest Li, also the new president of the Football Association of Singapore.

“We’re champions again! Campeones, ole, ole ole,” CNA reported fans chanting in celebration at Jurong East Stadium, as shown in a video shared on the club’s Facebook page.

The win brought the Sailors’ points tally to 71, placing them beyond reach of second-placed Tampines Rovers, who trail by eight points with only two games remaining.

Having finished second to Albirex Niigata in the past two seasons, the Sailors finally reclaimed the top spot in domestic football.

With the league title secured, the Sailors now shift focus to the AFC Champions League Two final on May 18 against Sharjah FC of the United Arab Emirates.

The match is set to be held at Bishan Stadium, with the Asian Football Confederation granting provisional approval, while efforts are underway to expand the venue’s capacity to 10,000.

Tickets to the final sold out within a day of going on sale, according to the club’s Facebook announcement last Wednesday.

Paris Saint-Germain needs only a tie next week in front of its own supporters at Parc des Princes to advance to the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League final after beating Arsenal 1-0 in Tuesday’s first leg semi in London.

French national team star Ousmane Dembele opened the scoring less than four minutes after kickoff at Emirates Stadium in the English capital. The decisive second match of the two-game, home-and-home, total-goals-wins series will be played on May 7.

Here are a few quick thoughts following Tuesday’s contest.

Play of the game

PSG defender Nuno Mendes started the play by finding Dembélé in space in the center of the field. The Frenchman passed to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia streaking down the wing, then continued his run into Arsenal’s penalty area. Kvaratskhelia’s beautiful return ball found Dembélé in strike, and he coolly first-timed his shot past the outstretched arm of Gunners goalkeeper David Raya to stun the home crowd at the Emirates.

Turning point

The hosts appeared to have canceled out Dembélé’s tally just after halftime, when Mikel Merino nodded a Declan Rice free-kick past PSG backstop Gianluigi Donnarumma. Unfortunately for most of those in attendance, the celebration was short-lived, as the video assistant referee determined that Merino had strayed just offside a split-second before Rice’s service.

Key stat

Contrary to popular belief, teams that win games on early goals usually get heavily out-possessed over 90 minutes; as their opponents desperately chase an equalizer, the squad in the lead is happy to absorb pressure and look to inflict the fatal blow via a counterattack.

That wasn’t the case on Tuesday. At one point midway through the first half, PSG had enjoyed the ball for a whopping 68-percent of the proceedings. And they finished the match with more than half of the overall possession – a damning stat for the home side.

What’s next for Paris Saint-Germain?

PSG, which three weeks ago clinched its 11th Ligue 1 title since its deep-pocketed Qatari owners bought the club in 2011, returns to domestic action when they visit Strasbourg on Saturday.

The big one looms three days later, when the Gunners visit the City of Light. PSG has reached the final just once before, in 2020, when Kylian Mbappe, Neymar & Co. fell to Bayern Munich in Lisbon.

What’s next for Arsenal?

Mikel Arteta’s side will return to Premier League action on Saturday versus local rivals Fulham. As is the case for PSG, that match is somewhat anticlimactic since Liverpool sealed the English crown last weekend. The Gunners, who lead third-place Newcastle by five points with four games left, remain in the driver’s seat to finish runner-up for the third consecutive season.

Arteta will no doubt prioritize next week’s rematch, as he should: While PSG deserved its win on Tuesday, they also squandered several golden opportunities to pad their lead. Kvaratskhelia was denied what he insisted should’ve been a penalty kick. Raya denied Desire Doue with an all-world save. Goncalo Ramos rattled the crossbar late in the second half.

If the Gunners score first next week in Paris, neutral fans will be in for a treat.

10b3b68d-1aa5-40a5-8cb3-219091ae560b,Champions League: Uefa re-open bidding for stadiums for 2027 final,"Uefa has reopened the bidding for stadiums to host the 2027 Champions League final, after the match was stripped from Milan.

The San Siro was to be the venue for the showcase final but, after Milan officials failed to assure Uefa that planned redevelopment work would not hamper the event, European football's governing body opted to take it away from them.

AC Milan and Inter Milan are considering building a new stadium in the San Siro area.

The new host stadium for the 2027 final is expected to be announced in May or June 2025.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Uefa Executive Committee on Tuesday, where changes to the organisation's solidarity funding was also agreed.

The 'big five' European leagues - the Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Serie A and Bundesliga - agreed to have their solidarity payments capped at 10m euros (£8.3m) per season up to and including 2026-27.

This is an increase of 1.5m euros on the previous cycle, but there are now 308m euros (£256.3m) to be shared rather than 177.2m euros (£147.4m) in the previous cycle.

The funds are allocated to clubs not participating in European competitions.

""Such funds are meant to support competitive balance across Europe's top division leagues, where some clubs benefit from additional revenue streams due to European competition participation,"" Uefa explained.

At Tuesday's meeting Uefa's women's football strategy for 2024 to 2030 was also agreed, though details of what it entails are yet to be released.",bbc.co.uk,2024-09-24T17:48:30.000000Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgryg9598q1o,0.25
0c189bab-ae9a-4fb3-b542-7dc3f9b7e5c4,What does Rangers' Champions League exit mean for finances?,"Governing body Uefa says, external £2.12bn will be distributed to participating Champions League clubs in 2024-25, while Europa League clubs will receive a share of £485m - roughly 22% of the Champions League monies.

Rangers reached the last 16 of the Europa League last season, while Celtic competed in the final group stage of the Champions League.

Both clubs will not reveal their income streams in their accounts for 2023-24 until later this year, but Rangers were a Champions League group-stage club in autumn 2022 and detailed £18.5m in Uefa revenue in that year's accounts.

In the previous year, which related to Rangers' run to the Europa League final, the club received £17.3m in Uefa prize money.

How much of this season's £485m is distributed to Rangers depends on how far they go in the competition and how many points they pick up at the new league phase.

They are guaranteed £3.7m, compared with the near £16m Celtic are guaranteed in the Champions League's new league phase.

A win in any of the eight league-phase games Rangers will play would be worth in the region of £386,000 and a draw £129,000. The Ibrox club will also receive a performance-related amount depending on where they finish at the end of the league phase.

Qualification to the Europa League knockout round is worth £257,000 per club, with £1.5m the prize for progressing to the last 16. The prize money increases to £2.15m in the quarter-finals, £2.6m in the semi-finals, £7m for reaching the final and an additional £6m goes to the winner.

Hence, like Rangers in season 2021-22, it would require a place in the Europa League final to get close to matching Champions League pre-knockout round participation income.",bbc.co.uk,2024-08-14T16:48:38.000000Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c77l86m8pp0o,0.5

Germany is witnessing a rise in hotel bookings as the country gears up to host the UEFA Champions League final on 31 May. According to data from SiteMinder, the world’s leading hotel distribution and revenue platform, reservations at local hotels between 29-31 May are currently higher by 32% compared to bookings made over the same period last year.

SiteMinder’s data further reveals that room rates have increased year-on-year in the lead-up to the final at Munich’s Allianz Arena, with the average daily rate (ADR) for stays during the period climbing by 10% to €265, from €241 last year. By contrast, the ADR in the preceding week was €56 lower, highlighting the spike in demand as the final game approaches.

Additionally, shifts in booking windows and lengths of stay reflect the impact of one of the world’s most anticipated football matches: travellers are locking in their stays at local properties earlier by 23 days, with the average booking lead time reaching 136 days, up from 113 days last year. Meanwhile, stays have shortened slightly year-on-year, with guests booking for an average of 1.57 nights, down from 1.83 nights over the same period in 2024.

“We saw during Germany’s hosting of UEFA Euros last year just how positive its impact was on local hotels, and it’s pleasing to see that the Champions League is proving no different, offering valuable momentum at a time when hotels are navigating more complex market dynamics,” says Andreas Kastl, SiteMinder’s Regional Manager – DACH. “With thousands of fans – both local and international – preparing to travel to Germany to see who takes home this year’s trophy, hotels are encouraged to fully embrace dynamic revenue practices that respond quickly to booking demand, whether through pricing or marketing strategies. For instance, longer booking windows give hotels more time to connect with their guests, creating opportunities to upsell and provide exclusive, personalised offers well before visiting fans arrive at the front desk.”

Ahead of the final showdown in Munich, the UEFA Champions League semi-finals will be played over two legs on 29-30 April and 6-7 May, with each of the qualifying teams set to host one match at their respective home stadiums across Europe. The venues will be confirmed following the quarter-final results.

We are close to knowing the semi-finals for men's Champions League, but before that, Women's Champions League is closing the knockout stages tomorrow, Sunday, April 27. The first leg took place last Sunday, with Olympique de Lyon having a short edge over Arsenal, 2-1... while Barcelona crushed Chelsea 4-1.

It wouldn't be too surprising if the same final from last year repeats: Lyon vs. Barcelona. Barcelona has won the cup twice in a row, 2023 and 2024, and Lyon won it 2022... and seven times before.

Meanwhile, Chelsea only reached the final once (losing to Barcelona in 2021) and Arsenal won it in 2007. Is there room for surprise? Chelsea has a near impossible mission of coming back from three goals down, but Arsenal still has the final in reach... and the possibility is there for Women's Champions League to have the same final as Men's Champions League.

Ever wondered which Champions League Finals football fans found the most captivating?

ARKA has recently conducted a study from various online video-sharing and social media platforms to find out the most discussed and viewed Champions League finals.

The most watched Champions League Finals

The study focused on the cumulative view numbers of these finals and the level of social engagement surrounding them. Compiled in May 2024, the data ranks all the finals from the most to the least viewed.

Firstly, the most-watched Champions League final is the 2015 matchup between Juventus and Barcelona, which has 18.2M views. Featuring the attacking trio of Messi, Neymar, and Suárez, contributed significantly to the high viewership, as they led Barcelona to a memorable 3-1 win.

The second most-watched final in the ranking is the 2016 clash between Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, attracting 17.2M viewers. This match earned the majority of its viewership for its dramatic finish in a penalty shootout after Sergio Ramos’ equalizer and Ronaldo’s winning goal in the shootout.

Bronze medal

Furthermore, third place was secured by the 2008 game between Manchester United and Chelsea, which drew 16.7M viewers. The high viewership of this match was driven by key moments such as John Terry’s infamous missed penalty and Cristiano Ronaldo’s early header, crucial for his first Champions League victory.

The fourth most popular final in the list is the 2017 match between Juventus and Real Madrid, attracting 15.3M viewers.

Champions League Finals: The miracle in Istanbul

Additionally, fifth in the ranking is the 2005 clash between AC Milan and Liverpool which gathered 14M views. Known as the “Miracle of Istanbul,” the match’s popularity mostly comes from Liverpool’s dramatic comeback from a three-goal deficit to win on penalties, making it one of the most iconic moments in football history.

To add to that, Chelsea vs Bayern Munich final in 2012 took sixth place, attracting 13.8M views. Furthermore,tThis game is memorable for Chelsea winning their first Champions League trophy in a dramatic penalty shootout, contributing to its high viewership and its place in the ranking.

Liverpool and Tottenham, which drew 11.3M viewers takes seventh. However, Liverpool’s early goal laid the groundwork for their 2-0 win, securing their sixth European title and making it one of the most viewed and discussed finals of the championship.

Rounding out the most watched Champions League Finals

Tied for ninth in viewership, the 2002 and 2014 Champions League finals both featuring Real Madrid attracted 10.4M views. The 2014 match featuring Real Madrid against Atletico Madrid is notable for Sergio Ramos’s late equalizer, which led to a dramatic 4-1 victory after extra time. This win secured Real Madrid their “La Decima” title.

Finally, rounding out the top ten, the 2018 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool attracted 9.7M viewers. The match also featured Real Madrid’s 3-1 victory, highlighted by Gareth Bale’s remarkable overhead kick, which sealed their third consecutive Champions League title.",thesouthafrican.com,2024-06-22T09:43:41.000000Z,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/sport/soccer/the-most-watched-champions-league-finals-in-history/,0.75

Where is the Champions League final 2025?

Bayern’s Allianz Arena will be the spectacular setting for this season’s Champions League final. Chelsea beat the German side there on penalties to win the trophy in 2012.

87f26118-395b-41e0-84bd-73da78d3ad3e,Barcelona sneak into Pot 1 for 2024-25 Champions League draw,"Barcelona will be in Pot 1 for the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League group stage draw after it was confirmed that AS Roma would not be in the competition.

Atalanta needed to finish fifth in Serie A for a place in the Champions League to pass down to Roma in sixth, but Atalanta's 3-0 win at home to Torino on Sunday secured a top-four place. Roma will take up a place in the Europa League.

If Atalanta had finished fifth, they would have qualified for the Champions League as Europa League titleholders, with the extra spot for Italy earned by their clubs' performance in Europe this season passed to sixth. Instead, that additional place will go to the team that did finish fifth, Bologna.

Barcelona would also have been overtaken for a place in Pot 1 by Bayer Leverkusen had the Bundesliga side avoided defeat in the Europa League final, but they lost 3-0 to Atalanta.

As Atalanta won't be using the titleholders' place, Benfica are promoted direct into the empty spot in the group stage as the club with the best coefficient of those in qualifying. If Real Madrid win the Champions League, Shakhtar Donetsk will also not have to qualify.

Under the new format which begins next season, only the Champions League holders are assured of a place in Pot 1, with all other places ordered by coefficient. However, with each team being drawn against two clubs from the four pots to create eight fixtures, the seeding of the pots now has limited relevance -- the teams in Pot 1 are not prevented from playing each other.

- New Champions League format explained

The Champions League is being expanded from 32 to 36 teams, with all placed in one league table. Eight matches will be played, four at home and four away. Teams from the same country should be kept apart, although leagues with 4+ teams may have to play one other from the same association if there's deadlocking in the draw.

As this new system throws up so many alternatives, the majority of the draw will be completed by a computer. A team will be drawn from Pot 1 in traditional style, and then the process of selecting that club's opponents will be performed automatically.

The top eight go straight through to the round of 16, positions eight to 24 play in a two-legged knockout playoff round, and those placed 25th to 36th are eliminated. There is no longer any dropdown into the Europa League.

The draw for the group stage takes place on Thursday, Aug. 29.

Local side AS Pirae turned the tables on Fijian side Rewa to earn a final spot at the 2024 OFC Champions League in Papeete on Thursday.

They had a 4-2 win in extra time.

They will line up against defending champions Auckland City, who beat AS Magenta 1-0 earlier in the day in the first semifinal.

The second semifinal started with AS Pirae making quick attacks inside the Rewa half.

But the visitors scored from the penalty box to lead 1-0 after the first 45-minute spell.

AS Pirae fought back and forced a 2-2 draw after 90 minutes.

They then scored two quick goals in extra time and then defended their ground and thwarted Rewa's attacks.

While Auckland will be chasing their 12th title, AS Pirae will be aiming to win Tahiti's first at the annual event, which started in 1987.

Auckland were made to work hard for their semifinal win by an AS Magenta side who had only one day's rest, following their rescheduled final group stage match against Ifira Black Bird on Monday afternoon.

Young wing Stipe Ukich was the match winner for Albert Riera's Auckland side.

The breakthrough came for the defending champions in the 66th minute. Ukich was found on the right-hand side of the box and showed considerable composure to cut inside a defender, before opening his body up and side-footing calmly into the far corner to give his side the lead.

AS Magenta's compacted schedule was taking a toll as the matche ticked towards the 90 minutes, with Auckland City showing their experience in controlling the tempo of the play.

Confirmed in knockout phase play-offs



None



Eliminated



Bologna, Red Star Belgrade, Girona, Leipzig, Slovan Bratislava, Sparta Prague, Sturm Graz, Young Boys.

What are the permutations for British teams in the final round?

Liverpool have guaranteed their place in the last 16 and will bypass the play-off round.

But, as explained above, they haven't yet secured top spot of the league stage.

Arsenal are all-but through to the last 16 after beating Zagreb.

Although TEN teams will start the final round of group matches within three points of the Gunners, Arsenal's +12 goal difference should be sufficient to see them through even if they lose next week to Girona.

So while Arsenal do still need at least a point to be mathematically certain of progression, only some very dramatic scorelines would demote them out of the top eight.

Arsenal are currently in third place which means, if they stayed in this position, they would face the winners of a play-off match featuring teams in 13th or 14th and 19th or 20th.

The teams currently in those positions are Brest (13th), Borussia Dortmund (14th), PSV Eindhoven (19th) and Club Brugge (20th).

Ninth-placed Aston Villa are one of the 10 teams within three points of Arsenal but such is the congestion that only a win next Wednesday against Celtic will realistically be enough for Unai Emery's side to have any hope of finishing in the top eight.

Celtic's late victory over Young Boys means they will definitely be in the play-offs.

And a win at Villa would give them a chance of reaching the last 16 automatically - although it remains an unlikely prospect even in the event of a victory at Villa Park given there are 10 teams between them and the top eight.

Then there's Manchester City.

Incredibly, Pep Guardiola's team will begin the final round in the relegation zone from the league stage.

Two points and a place below Stuttgart in the top 24, only a victory over Club Brugge will be enough for City to sneak into the play-offs. A win would leave them level on points with Brugge but with a superior goal difference, victory WILL be enough for City to escape the drop zone.

The play-off rounds take place on February 11/12 and February 18/19.

Who could British clubs play next?

There may be some confusion over what this means for your team, so as it stands, let's take a look at what the path for the British teams looks like...

Liverpool (Current seed: 1st)

Knockout playoffs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Bayern Munich (15th), Real Madrid (16th), Juventus (17th) or Celtic (18th)

Arsenal (Current seed: 3rd)

Knockout playoffs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Brest (13th), Dortmund (14th), PSV (19th) or Club Brugge (20th)

Aston Villa (Current seed: 9th)

Knockout playoffs: vs Sporting (23rd) or Stuttgart (24th)

Round of 16: vs Atalanta (7th) or Leverkusen (8th)

Celtic (Current seed: 18th)

Knockout playoffs: vs Bayern Munich (15th) or Real Madrid (16th)

Round of 16: vs Liverpool (1st) or Barcelona (2nd)

Manchester City (Current seed: 25th)

As it stands, Manchester City would be eliminated from European football.

Who qualifies out of the league phase?

To achieve automatic qualification into the round of 16 in March, teams must finish in the top eight.

Those in ninth to 24th enter a round of two-legged play-offs in February, with the winners taking the other eight spots in the last 16.

Those who finish ninth to 16th will be seeded for the play-offs, so will have the second leg at home. Those from 17th to 24th will be unseeded, so have the first leg at home.

Teams that finish anywhere from 25th to 36th will be eliminated from this season's competition, with no access to the Europa League.

Ok, but if we're in the top eight, does it matter if I finish first or eighth?

Yes, it does. The way the Champions League league phase works is the final league position gives you a specific route - and specific opponents - in the knockout stage draw.

The below graphic shows the tournament tree for the rest of the competition. For the first time ever, the knockout rounds are decided by the league phase - with no separate draws for the last-16, quarter-finals and beyond.

For example, the teams who finish first or second in the league phase will face a team who finishes in 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th.

Compare that to the team who finishes in seventh or eighth, who could play a team who finishes in 23rd or 24th but also run the risk of facing the team in ninth or 10th spot - which could be a major European outfit.

The advantage for the team finishing first or second is they will guarantee playing a team in the 'middle' of the final Champions League table. Finishing lower down runs the risk of playing a better side.

When are the 2024/25 Champions League knockout stages?

Knockout round play-offs: February 11/12 and February 18/19, 2025

Round of 16: March 4/5 and March 11/12, 2025

Quarter-finals: April 8/9 and April 15/16, 2025

74ca6fa7-79e8-444e-9e1b-127e13d4ed69,Champions League final price freeze for fans of competing teams but big increases for high-end seats,"NYON, Switzerland (AP) — Ticket prices at the men’s Champions League final are unchanged from last year for most fans of the two competing teams with big increases only for high-end seats, UEFA said Monday.

Each finalist will get 18,000 tickets for the May 31 game at Bayern Munich’s stadium with a special lowest-price rate of 70 euros ($77). That’s the same price as the lowest cost tickets at the 2024 final played at Wembley Stadium in London.

Substantial price hikes have been added to the two highest-rated categories of seats. Top-price tickets go from 713 euros ($781) last year to 950 euros ($1,040) this time, and “category 2” tickets rise from 500 euros ($548) last year to 650 euros ($712), UEFA said.

Ticket revenue from UEFA club finals goes into the overall pot of billions of euros (dollars) in revenue from broadcasting and commercial deals that is mostly paid back to hundreds of clubs each season as prize money and solidarity payments. Real Madrid, the Champions League winner last year, got the highest payment of $154 million from UEFA.

UEFA said 38,700 tickets of the 64,500 available for the showpiece game in Munich are sold “directly for fans and the general public to purchase.”

In addition to quotas for the two finalists, a further 2,700 tickets can be bought by fans worldwide on UEFA’s website. Buyers are limited to two tickets.

More than 25,000 tickets are reserved for sponsors, broadcasters, national soccer federations and UEFA guests.

12a693dc-927d-4a78-b4e6-7e0c9d3e676c,Borussia Dortmund reaches Champions League final by beating PSG 1-0 on Hummels header,"Hey there, time traveller!

This article was published 07/05/2024 (369 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

PARIS (AP) — London’s calling, but not for Kylian Mbappé.

When Borussia Dortmund’s players rushed over to their fans wearing yellow “London 24” T-shirts and joined in the celebrations after knocking out Paris Saint-Germain to reach the Champions League final on Tuesday, Mbappé had long left the field.

Wembley Stadium on June 1 is the final stop on Dortmund’s quest for the Champions League trophy, by which time Mbappé will have played his last game for PSG having failed to win the trophy the club’s cash-rich Qatari owners so crave.

Central defender Mats Hummels headed Dortmund into the final as the German team won 1-0 at PSG.

Moments after Warren Zaïre-Emery missed an open goal for PSG, Hummels rose unchallenged to head in Julian Brandt’s corner from the left in the 50th minute.

Dortmund advanced 2-0 on aggregate and largely contained Mbappé, who is leaving at the end of the season.

PSG exerted late pressure.

Goalkeeper Gregor Kobel palmed away Mbappé’s low shot, then pushed Mbappé’s deflected close-range effort onto the crossbar with a superb one-handed save. The Parc des Princes crowd groaned when midfielder Vitinha’s thumping 25-meter strike rattled the woodwork.

Coach Edin Terzić’s team will play either record 14-time champion Real Madrid or six-time winner Bayern Munich on June 1 at Wembley Stadium. Madrid and Bayern drew 2-2 in the first leg and play on Wednesday.

“Extremely proud. I’m very happy,” Terzić said. “We beat a team like PSG two times and we again kept a clean sheet. We started really well and kept them away from the goal.”

Dortmund is on course for its second Champions League trophy after winning in 1997 and a third European trophy, having won the now defunct UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup in 1966. Dortmund also reached the Champions League final in 2013, losing to Bayern.

“Indescribable. After more than 10 years, I am in the final with Borussia again,” said Marco Reus, Dortmund’s veteran midfielder who is leaving the team after this season. “How we won the game, no one will ask tomorrow. Shots against the post won’t matter tomorrow.”

For PSG, it’s another season ending without raising the trophy its cash-rich Qatari owners have chased after by spending huge amounts on star players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Neymar, Lionel Messi and Mbappé. PSG lost its only Champions League final in 2020 to Bayern.

“Efficiency, that’s what we were missing,” PSG captain Marquinhos said. “We should have defended better. They scored from a corner and a counter-attack (in the first leg). We created more chances but they won both games.”

As Dortmund’s players celebrated, Mbappé looked dejected as he trudged for the last time in a Champions League game wearing a PSG jersey. He is widely expected to join Madrid.

Moments before Dortmund’s goal, Zaïre-Emery somehow hit the post from two meters out after Gonçalo Ramos flicked on Mbappé’s cross from the left.

On Hummels’ goal, PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma again did not move off his line to claim the ball, having not done so when Barcelona scored on a corner from the left in the first leg of the quarterfinals.

Coach Luis Enrique’s players seemed nervous, playing cautiously and defending too deeply in the first half, allowing Dortmund to settle into a comfortable rhythm.

Mbappé was ineffective in attack when PSG lost the first leg and, despite their speed, Mbappé and Ousmane Dembélé struggled to find space behind a well-organized Dortmund defense with midfielder Emre Can offering good protection.

It took 30 minutes before Mbappé and Zaïre-Emery freed Dembélé on the right of the penalty area, but he failed to hit the target.

Speedy left winger Karim Adeyemi did so for Dortmund five minutes later when a rapid counter-attack exposed PSG’s defense, but Donnarumma rescued PSG with a fine low save.

Hummel’s goal at least woke up PSG’s attack, but Ramos missed the target when well-placed either side of a stinging shot from left back Nuno Mendes hitting the left post.

Dembélé then cut inside Hummels, who was perhaps unfortunate not to concede a penalty midway through the second half. Referee Daniele Orsato awarded a free kick.

PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pointed to the amount of times PSG hit the post or crossbar over both legs.

But in reality PSG again fell short, despite boasting one of the world’s best players in Mbappé.

PSG only qualified for the knockout stage in the last round of group games, losing at Newcastle and AC Milan and finishing second behind Dortmund. Overall, PSG lost five games in the competition.

Mbappé’s last home game for PSG — which has already clinched the French league title — will be Sunday against Toulouse, and his last game for the club May 25 in the French Cup final against Lyon.

In Lille and not London.

26ab3cdf-154d-4f70-a4a0-d0dffdd13aff,Dinamo Zagreb’s Champions League match schedule released,"Dinamo Zagreb has learned its match schedule for the 2024/2025 UEFA Champions League.

Dinamo drew Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Arsenal, AC Milan, Celtic, Salzburg, Monaco and S. Bratislava.

Under the new format, each of the 36 clubs plays eight matches in four home games and four away games.

The top eight teams in the league will move directly to the knockout stages, while teams finishing between ninth and 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off for a spot in the last 16.

Here is Dinamo’s schedule:



• 17 September 2024, 21:00 – FC Bayern Munich (A)

• 2 October 2024, 21:00 – AS Monaco (H)

• 23 October 2024, 21:00 – FC Salzburg (A)

• 5 November 2024, 18:45 – SK Slovan Bratislava (A)

• 27 November 2024, 21:00 – Borussia Dortmund (H)

• 10 December 2024, 18:45 – Celtic FC (H)

• 21 January 2025, 21:00 – Arsenal FC (A)

• 29 January 2025, 21:00 – AC Milan (H)

Clubs ranked twenty-fifth to thirty-sixth are eliminated from Europe, meaning they do not continue in the Europa League.

The first round of the Champions League will be played from Tuesday to Thursday, with the remaining seven rounds, as usual, taking place on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

The knockout phase begins on 11 February, and the final will be held on 31 May at the Allianz Arena.

Jakirović Satisfied with the Draw

“I am satisfied with the draw because this is the Champions League. We will battle with everyone to see where we stand at that level, and there are teams against whom I believe we can compete and it will be 50-50. Let’s see how many points we can take,” the Dinamo manager said after the draw.",croatiaweek.com,2024-08-31T11:33:22.000000Z,https://www.croatiaweek.com/dinamo-zagrebs-champions-league-match-schedule-released/,0.5
e63c21e2-a191-4604-92e4-5def125824cd,"UEFA Seeks ""Competitive Balance"" With New Champions League 2024-25 Format","A new era in European club football begins on Thursday when the draw takes place in Monaco for an expanded UEFA Champions League featuring a radically changed format. European football's governing body is selling what it describes as ""a thrilling new future"" for the game on the continent with more teams playing more matches, and more prize money on offer. UEFA needs to generate hype around the new format, because there is a risk -- in the beginning at least -- that fans will find it confusing compared to the old model.

For the last 21 years, the Champions League had consisted of a group stage in which 32 clubs were split into eight groups of four, each playing six games. The top two in each group qualified for the knockout phase.

The new version will feature 36 clubs with everyone playing eight matches, but all teams pooled together into one giant league rather than in groups.

Clubs will still be split into four seeded pots of nine teams, with every participant given two opponents from each pot.

The top eight in the final ranking go through to the last 16, while the next 16 sides advance to an intermediate play-off round and the remainder go out.

The new format was introduced against the backdrop of the threat by Europe's biggest clubs to break away and form their own Super League.

But UEFA are also hoping the format can be a solution to the problem of competitive imbalance in the sport which was making the group stage more predictable.

""The new format will introduce a better competitive balance between all the teams, with the possibility for each team to play opponents of a similar competitive level throughout the league phase,"" UEFA say.

Financial rewards

What the changes will certainly not address are concerns about too much football being played and damaging the quality as a result.

The increasing demands on players, and the lack of rest as a result, were cited as reasons why many matches at Euro 2024 proved disappointing.

The new Champions League, in a season which is also set to finish with the first expanded version of FIFA's Club World Cup, will feature a total of 144 games in the group stage, up from 96 before.

The financial rewards are greater, however, with UEFA's total prize pot for the Champions League rising by about 25 percent to almost 2.5 billion euros ($2.79 billion).

The winners of the competition can pocket over 86 million euros just in prize money, not including bonuses of 700,000 euros for every point gained in the league phase or income from television.

Real Madrid were the winners last season, raising the trophy for the sixth time in the last 11 years.

The addition of Kylian Mbappe to their squad means they will hope to go all the way again, and emerge victorious in the final in Munich on May 31, next year.

Newcomers

This season's Champions League will include newcomers such as Girona from Spain, while Bologna of Italy take part in Europe's elite club competition for the first time in 60 years.

Brest of France had never qualified for any European competition before, but now take part after finishing third in Ligue 1 last season -- taking advantage of the extra place handed to France as the fifth-ranked league in Europe.

As for the other additional places, one goes to a national champion who will emerge from the qualifying rounds, while Italy and Germany get an extra team each because of the performances of their clubs in Europe last season.

UEFA said the draw itself will be a ""hybrid"" affair, between the manual drawing of balls and the use of software, having calculated that doing it all by hand would take more than three hours.

The Europa League and Conference League, the draws for which will both take place on Friday, will also now feature 36 teams, although there will be only six matches for clubs in the league phase of the latter competition.

The 2024-25 UEFA Champions League final is set after the semifinals concluded this midweek, meaning we are not far away from the ultimate showdown with legacies on the line. Back in July, the qualifying round started as 81 teams had dreams of conquering Europe, and the first-ever 36-team league phase brought the drama like never before, leaving just two teams left standing. Here's everything you need to know about the big game:

Who is playing in the Champions League final?

The final will be between Italian club Inter and French club Paris Saint-Germain. Inter beat Barcelona in the most epic semifinals in history while PSG cruised past Arsenal.

Inter have won the competition three times in their history and were just in the final just three seasons ago, losing to mighty Manchester City, 1-0. PSG, meanwhile, have never won the competition in their history, as they look to become just the second French team to lift the title after Marseille. PSG have made the final once, doing so back in 2020, losing to Bayern Munich during COVID.

Neither team was really viewed as a legit threat to win the competition as it's been largely dominated by Spanish, English and German clubs. No team outside of those three countries has won it since Inter did it back in 2010, and France's lone title was in 1993.

Inter have had to replace stars over the years yet have remained competitive, knocking out Bayern Munich and Barcelona before reaching the final. Some may have viewed Inter as a threat, and they would be wise to do so with their experience together and continued improvement, but most would have chosen sides like Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid as more likely to win it all this season.

PSG have been viewed as somewhat contenders over the last several years, having stars like Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi. They entered this season with neither after Mbappe's move to Real Madrid, and go figure -- they make the final and are the early favorites.

When and where is the Champions League final?

The final will take place on Saturday, May 31. The venue hosting is the Allianz Arena in Munich Germany. UCL games are typically on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, although this season did see a Thursday matchday, but the final is always played on a Saturday.

What time does it start?

The final is set for 3 p.m. ET on Saturday, May 31.

From the 2024/2025 season, the UEFA Champions League will be contested under a radically different format.

The change of format comes as the tournament expands from a 32-team showpiece, swelling to 36 teams from next term.

“UEFA has clearly shown that we are fully committed to respecting the fundamental values of sport and to defending the key principle of open competitions, with qualification based on sporting merit, fully in line with the values and solidarity-based European sports model,” said UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin. “I am really pleased that it was a unanimous decision of the UEFA Executive Committee, with the European Club Association, European Leagues and national associations all agreeing with the proposal made.

“Another proof that European football is more united than ever.”

How will the UEFA Champions League format change?

Under the new Champions League format, teams will play eight matches in the new league phase, which replaces the former group stage.

Teams in the Champions League will no longer play three opponents twice – home and away.

Instead qualified teams face fixtures against eight different sides, playing half of those matches at home and half away across the eight matchdays.

Will there still be a UEFA Champions League draw

There will still be a Champions League draw for the league phase.

Four seeding pots of nine teams will be settled by rankings. These rankings will be based on the current co-efficient system.

Each team will then be drawn to play two opponents from each of these pots. They will play one match against a team from each pot, home and away.

UEFA said: “This gives the opportunity for clubs to test themselves against a wider range of opponents and raises the prospect for fans of seeing the top teams go head to head more often and earlier in the competition. It will also result in more competitive matches for every club across the board.”

In effect this brings about the radical departure. The UEFA Champions League will take on a different look from next season.

How will teams reach the knockout phase?

The outcomes of each match will determine the overall standing in the new league, with three points for a victory and one for a draw remaining the points system in use.

The top eight clubs in the league will advance to the round of 16, while the teams ranking ninth to twenty-fourth will participate in an additional two-legged knockout phase play-off to clinch their spot in the competition’s final 16.

Elimination faces teams who finish 25th or lower. They will not be eligible to compete in the UEFA Europa League.

UEFA claim: “The new format, with all the teams ranked together in a single league, will mean that there is more to play for all the way through to the final night of the league phase.”

After Liverpool's 2-1 victory over Lille, Reds head coach Slot, whose side top the table, said ""we still don't know yet"" if it is an advantage for clubs to end as first or second seed (where his side will end) or simply finish in the top eight.

The higher a team finishes in the league table, the higher they are 'seeded', and that should - based on league performance - determine an easier path to the final.

Champions League - what we know so far Confirmed in round of 16



Liverpool, Barcelona



Confirmed in round of 16 or knockout phase play-offs



Arsenal, Aston Villa, Atalanta, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Brest, Celtic, Dortmund, Feyenoord, Inter Milan, Juventus, Leverkusen, Lille, AC Milan, Monaco, Real Madrid



Confirmed in knockout phase play-offs



None



Eliminated



Bologna, Red Star Belgrade, Girona, Leipzig, Slovan Bratislava, Sparta Prague, Sturm Graz, Young Boys.

Why does finishing higher in the Champions League league table matter?

Overall, there are two paths to the knockout phase from the league phase:

Finish in the top eight and go straight through to the round of 16 Finish from ninth to 24th and go through to a two-legged knockout play-off

Teams who finish from 25th-36th are eliminated and unlike previous seasons, no team will drop into the Europa League.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liverpool head coach Arne Slot says the new league format in the Champions League 'doesn't tell you everything'

But within those paths, the higher a team finishes within each of the groups that qualify, the better their route to the later stages of the tournament will be.

For example:

If a team finishes first or second, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the 17th/18th and 15th/16th seeds in the round of 16.

If a team finishes seventh or eighth, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the ninth/10th and 23rd/24th seeds in the round of 16.

Image: The Champions League knockout bracket in full

If a team finishes 15th or 16th, they will play either the 17th or 18th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the first or second seed in the round of 16.

If a team finishes 21st or 22nd, they will play either the 11th or 12th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the fifth or sixth seed in the round of 16.

Essentially the higher a team places, the better chance they have of avoiding another higher seed early in the knockout phase.

Wait, so Liverpool finishing first or second doesn't make a difference?

Not significantly. With teams grouped in this way, both first and second will be seeded and then drawn against teams that have finished 15th-18th and progress from their play-off. Both first and second will get to play the second leg of that last-16 tie at home.

But if Liverpool finish first or second, why don't they play the worst team (23rd or 24th)?

In theory, Liverpool (and likely Barcelona) will play the worst teams in the competition when they re-enter it. The seeding system is designed so a higher seed will get an easier run to the final.

If the knockout play-off games go as planned, the higher-seeded teams will win their games - therefore, the teams ranked ninth to 16th will make it through to the last 16, and the teams ranked 17th to 24th will be knocked out. In that case, Liverpool would indeed play one of the two worst teams remaining.

Additionally, the pathway is as much about avoiding the higher seeds as it is about playing against the lower ones. By finishing in the top two, Liverpool will avoid any team seeded higher than 15th in the round of 16, any team higher than seventh in the quarter-final, and cannot play the other top-seeded team until the final.

Is there a draw for the Champions League knockout round? When is it?

There will be two draws after the league phase.

The first draw on Friday January 31 at 11am will determine which of the two options each team will get in the knockout play-off. For example, a team finishing 13th will find out whether they are playing against the team finishing 19th or 20th.

Seeded teams (ninth-16th) will have the second leg at home and those play-off round matches take place on February 11/12 and February 18/19.

Teams seeded from first to eighth will have to wait until Friday February 21 to find out their opponents.

That draw will then determine who they face in the round of 16, and ultimately map out their full path to the final.

Can teams from the same country face each other in the knockout playoffs?

Yes. Unlike previous years in which they were kept apart in the first draw, teams can face others from the same country - and other teams who they already played in the league phase - in the knockout play-offs and beyond.

I'm a fan of a British club - who will we play next and what do we need in the final week?

There may be some confusion over what this means for your team, so as it stands, let's take a look at what the path for the British teams looks like right now and what they each need to finish as high as possible in the final standings...

Liverpool (Current seed: 1st)

Knockout play-offs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Bayern Munich (15th), Real Madrid (16th), Juventus (17th) or Celtic (18th)

What Liverpool need in the final week: Technically nothing as they are secured a top-two seed. However, a point against PSV (or bettering Barcelona's result) will mean they top the league-phase table.

Arsenal (Current seed: 3rd)

Knockout play-offs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Brest (13th), Dortmund (14th), PSV (19th) or Club Brugge (20th)

What Arsenal need in the final week: They are all but certain to finish in the top eight, as the teams below them would need to significantly better their result to move above them. A point against Girona secures a top-eight place and a win keeps them as a third or fourth seed.

Aston Villa (Current seed: 9th)

Knockout play-offs: vs Sporting (23rd) or Stuttgart (24th)

Round of 16: vs Atalanta (7th) or Leverkusen (8th)

What Aston Villa need in the final week: They have secured a spot in the knockout play-offs. To move into the top eight, they need a win against Celtic combined with a loss by either Atletico Madrid, Milan, Atalanta or Bayer Leverkusen - but also need to maintain their better goal difference than the four teams directly below them. They can technically get in with a draw but would need a miracle with several other results to go their way!

Celtic (Current seed: 18th)

Knockout playoffs: vs Bayern Munich (15th) or Real Madrid (16th)

Round of 16: vs Liverpool (1st) or Barcelona (2nd)

What Celtic need in the final week: They have secured a spot in the knockout play-offs and are still fighting for a higher seeding. They can technically reach the top eight but would need to beat Aston Villa and have a large number of other results go their way.

Manchester City (Current seed: 25th)

As it stands, Manchester City would be eliminated from European football.

What Manchester City need in the final week: They will secure a knockout play-off spot by beating Club Brugge - who need a point to secure a place of their own. A draw will not be enough for Man City to go through.

Image: Pep Guardiola and Man City are 25th in the table and heading out of the competition as it stands

How much could the table change in the last week?

A lot! On Tuesday night last week, Julian Alvarez's 90th-minute winner moved Atletico Madrid from 11th to third in the table in a matter of seconds.

With just one game to go, just three points separate the teams in eighth (Leverkusen, 13 points) and 24th (Stuttgart, 10 points)!

Plenty of movement will happen, and to add to the drama, every single match on the final matchday is being played at the same time - 8pm kick-off on Wednesday January 29.

Will there be any 'dead rubbers' in the final week?

Only two!

Ahead of the final matchday, nine teams have been mathematically eliminated - Bologna, Sparta Prague, RB Leipzig, Girona, Red Star Belgrade, Sturm Graz, RB Salzburg, Slovan Bratislava and Young Boys.

Red Star Belgrade face Young Boys on the final day, while Sturm Graz play RB Leipzig in matches that will not affect the final seedings, but every other team is involved in a meaningful game.

What Manchester City need in the final week: They will secure a knockout play-off spot by beating Club Brugge - who need a point to secure a place of their own. A draw will not be enough for Man City to go through.

How much could the table change in the last week?

A lot! On Tuesday night last week, Julian Alvarez's 90th-minute winner moved Atletico Madrid from 11th to third in the table in a matter of seconds.

With just one game to go, just three points separate the teams in eighth (Leverkusen, 13 points) and 24th (Stuttgart, 10 points)!

Plenty of movement will happen, and to add to the drama, every single match on the final matchday is being played at the same time - 8pm kick-off on Wednesday January 29.

Will there be any 'dead rubbers' in the final week?

Only two!

Ahead of the final matchday, nine teams have been mathematically eliminated - Bologna, Sparta Prague, RB Leipzig, Girona, Red Star Belgrade, Sturm Graz, RB Salzburg, Slovan Bratislava and Young Boys.

Red Star Belgrade face Young Boys on the final day, while Sturm Graz play RB Leipzig in matches that will not affect the final seedings, but every other team is involved in a meaningful game.

After Liverpool's 2-1 victory over Lille, Reds head coach Slot, whose side top the table, said ""we still don't know yet"" if it is an advantage for clubs to end as first or second seed (where his side will end) or simply finish in the top eight.

The higher a team finishes in the league table, the higher they are 'seeded', and that should - based on league performance - determine an easier path to the final.

Champions League - what we know so far Confirmed in round of 16

Confirmed in round of 16 or knockout phase play-offs



Arsenal, Aston Villa, Atalanta, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Brest, Celtic, Dortmund, Feyenoord, Inter Milan, Juventus, Leverkusen, Lille, AC Milan, Monaco, Real Madrid

Bologna, Red Star Belgrade, Girona, Leipzig, Slovan Bratislava, Sparta Prague, Sturm Graz, Young Boys.

Why does finishing higher in the Champions League league table matter?

Overall, there are two paths to the knockout phase from the league phase:

Finish in the top eight and go straight through to the round of 16 Finish from ninth to 24th and go through to a two-legged knockout play-off

Teams who finish from 25th-36th are eliminated and unlike previous seasons, no team will drop into the Europa League.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liverpool head coach Arne Slot says the new league format in the Champions League 'doesn't tell you everything'

But within those paths, the higher a team finishes within each of the groups that qualify, the better their route to the later stages of the tournament will be.

For example:

If a team finishes first or second, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the 17th/18th and 15th/16th seeds in the round of 16.

If a team finishes seventh or eighth, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the ninth/10th and 23rd/24th seeds in the round of 16.

Image: The Champions League knockout bracket in full

If a team finishes 15th or 16th, they will play either the 17th or 18th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the first or second seed in the round of 16.

If a team finishes 21st or 22nd, they will play either the 11th or 12th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the fifth or sixth seed in the round of 16.

Essentially the higher a team places, the better chance they have of avoiding another higher seed early in the knockout phase.

Wait, so Liverpool finishing first or second doesn't make a difference?

Not significantly. With teams grouped in this way, both first and second will be seeded and then drawn against teams that have finished 15th-18th and progress from their play-off. Both first and second will get to play the second leg of that last-16 tie at home.

But if Liverpool finish first or second, why don't they play the worst team (23rd or 24th)?

In theory, Liverpool (and likely Barcelona) will play the worst teams in the competition when they re-enter it. The seeding system is designed so a higher seed will get an easier run to the final.

If the knockout play-off games go as planned, the higher-seeded teams will win their games - therefore, the teams ranked ninth to 16th will make it through to the last 16, and the teams ranked 17th to 24th will be knocked out. In that case, Liverpool would indeed play one of the two worst teams remaining.

Additionally, the pathway is as much about avoiding the higher seeds as it is about playing against the lower ones. By finishing in the top two, Liverpool will avoid any team seeded higher than 15th in the round of 16, any team higher than seventh in the quarter-final, and cannot play the other top-seeded team until the final.

Is there a draw for the Champions League knockout round? When is it?

There will be two draws after the league phase.

The first draw on Friday January 31 at 11am will determine which of the two options each team will get in the knockout play-off. For example, a team finishing 13th will find out whether they are playing against the team finishing 19th or 20th.

Seeded teams (ninth-16th) will have the second leg at home and those play-off round matches take place on February 11/12 and February 18/19.

Teams seeded from first to eighth will have to wait until Friday February 21 to find out their opponents.

That draw will then determine who they face in the round of 16, and ultimately map out their full path to the final.

Can teams from the same country face each other in the knockout playoffs?

Yes. Unlike previous years in which they were kept apart in the first draw, teams can face others from the same country - and other teams who they already played in the league phase - in the knockout play-offs and beyond.

I'm a fan of a British club - who will we play next and what do we need in the final week?

There may be some confusion over what this means for your team, so as it stands, let's take a look at what the path for the British teams looks like right now and what they each need to finish as high as possible in the final standings...

Liverpool (Current seed: 1st)

Knockout play-offs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Bayern Munich (15th), Real Madrid (16th), Juventus (17th) or Celtic (18th)

What Liverpool need in the final week: Technically nothing as they are secured a top-two seed. However, a point against PSV (or bettering Barcelona's result) will mean they top the league-phase table.

Arsenal (Current seed: 3rd)

Knockout play-offs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Brest (13th), Dortmund (14th), PSV (19th) or Club Brugge (20th)

What Arsenal need in the final week: They are all but certain to finish in the top eight, as the teams below them would need to significantly better their result to move above them. A point against Girona secures a top-eight place and a win keeps them as a third or fourth seed.

Aston Villa (Current seed: 9th)

Knockout play-offs: vs Sporting (23rd) or Stuttgart (24th)

Round of 16: vs Atalanta (7th) or Leverkusen (8th)

What Aston Villa need in the final week: They have secured a spot in the knockout play-offs. To move into the top eight, they need a win against Celtic combined with a loss by either Atletico Madrid, Milan, Atalanta or Bayer Leverkusen - but also need to maintain their better goal difference than the four teams directly below them. They can technically get in with a draw but would need a miracle with several other results to go their way!

Celtic (Current seed: 18th)

Knockout playoffs: vs Bayern Munich (15th) or Real Madrid (16th)

Round of 16: vs Liverpool (1st) or Barcelona (2nd)

What Celtic need in the final week: They have secured a spot in the knockout play-offs and are still fighting for a higher seeding. They can technically reach the top eight but would need to beat Aston Villa and have a large number of other results go their way.

Manchester City (Current seed: 25th)

As it stands, Manchester City would be eliminated from European football.

What Manchester City need in the final week: They will secure a knockout play-off spot by beating Club Brugge - who need a point to secure a place of their own. A draw will not be enough for Man City to go through.

Mamelodi Sundowns defender Khuliso Mudau believes it will only be fitting that the club wins Caf Champions League after going all the way in the African Football League (AFL) earlier this season.

The reigning DStv Premiership champions are still in the hunt for their second Champions League title.



The last time the Brazilians soared to such heights was in 2016 when they lifted the coveted club competition.

Esperance stand in their way of place in this season’s final. They will play the Tunisian giants in a two-legged semifinal clash later this month.

“Obviously, we wanted to win the AFL and I think every player was ready mentally to fight. Even when we were playing away at Al-Ahly and Wydad, we were ready to give it our all,” said Mudau who was also part of Bafana Bafana’s team that won a bronze medal at the recent Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Côte d’Ivoire.

“We promised ourselves and the technical team that we want to win the first AFL trophy and it was very important. It’s like the Champions League, it’s very important for us win it.

“Just imagine that I played for Bafana Bafana and won the bronze medal and then I don’t win the Champions League. It doesn’t make sense so it’s important for us to win the Champions League and everyone is ready to fight,” commented the Sundowns defender.

The former Black Leopards right-back reflected on the emotional celebrations that were captured on TV when he embraced his family shortly after lifting the AFL at Loftus Versfeld in November last year.

“I was very emotional because I promised my family that I’m going to win the AFL,” he added.

“So it was great to win a cup like the AFL. It means a lot because many people played and they didn’t manage to win these kind of cups. So it does mean a lot for me as player and it was a great feeling and I was very emotional.”

Sundowns will first be away to Esperance on April 19 before the return league at home seven days later with winner set to contest the 2024 final against either Ahly or TP Mazembe.",citizen.co.za,2024-04-10T05:09:00.000000Z,https://www.citizen.co.za/sport/soccer/local-soccer/sundowns-ready-to-fight-for-caf-champions-league-title/,1.0
1885e36d-225f-4f87-90f0-245b4ffb6c81,Women's Super League final day: Stories of the 2024-25 season from champions Chelsea to relegated Crystal Palace,"The Women's Super League title might be Chelsea's again, but there were plenty more stories that contributed to an enthralling 2024-25 season. From signings to sackings, Sky Sports analyses the best of them.

Manager merry-go-round

The season of sackings. Five managers were swapped out as the number of long-serving coaches in the division dwindled. March was the most extraordinary month, containing three sackings in quick succession.

Liverpool parted ways with Matt Beard, Crystal Palace announced the departure of Laura Kaminski, while Manchester City made the shock decision to axe Gareth Taylor days before the League Cup final, which City lost to Chelsea - questions over the bizarre timing remain unanswered.

Image: Man City sacked Gareth Taylor just five days before the League Cup final

Arsenal and Aston Villa opted to make changes much earlier in the campaign. Jonas Eidevall walked in October after a poor run of form made for frosty relations with Gunners fans - something he later called 'a cloud' over the heads of his players. Renee Slegers, Eidevall's former No 2, has done a fine job of steadying the ship since stepping up.

Meanwhile, Robert de Pauw left Aston Villa in December after a pretty disastrous six-month spell, claiming just six points from their opening nine games this season. Manchester United's Marc Skinner is now the longest-serving manager in the WSL.

Can anyone beat Chelsea?

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of the Women's Super League match between Manchester United and Chelsea.

Chelsea's decade of dominance has continued in remarkable fashion. They won their sixth successive WSL title (and eighth overall) by beating Manchester United 1-0 in April - the earliest the league has been decided since 2018-19.

Having also claimed the League Cup this term, the Blues have now won 16 major trophies - all since 2015.

This season has been another exhibition of inevitability from the reigning champions. A reminder to all who suggested their crown might slip following the end of the Emma Hayes era that the established hierarchy is no less immovable.

The 'Invincibles' tag is still to play for, as Sonia Bompastor's side aim to become the first team to go unbeaten across a 22-game campaign. No added incentive needed, but for some extra spice: beat Liverpool on Saturday, live on Sky Sports, and Chelsea would set a new WSL points record too (60).

Summer signings dazzle

There was plenty of smart business done by clubs last summer, but these five have particularly caught the eye.

Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal)

Shekiera Martinez (West Ham)

Elisabeth Terland (Man Utd)

Olivia Smith (Liverpool)

Sandy Baltimore (Chelsea)

Of those named, Caldentey has got to be the headline act. And if you need convincing just watch her screamer in Arsenal's recent European win over Lyon. Proper player.

The 29-year-old arrived from Barcelona with the reputation of a world-beater and has more than delivered on such esteem. Only Alessia Russo, the newly crowned Football Writers' Association Women's Footballer of the Year, has been directly involved in more goals for Arsenal - and goals aren't even the best part.

She excels in almost every creative category, a player that glides effortlessly across a football pitch and can hurt you from all angles. Play her as a winger, in the No 10 pocket, or a deep-lying midfielder - she can do the lot. Slegers rightly calls her ""total football"".

A shoutout to January addition Chloe Kelly, too, for her instantaneous impact during the Gunners' impressive upturn. She always has been a star.

What goes up must come down?

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of the Women's Super League match between Crystal Palace and West Ham United.

A year on from the joyous scenes of a momentous Championship winning season, Crystal Palace are back where they started.

Having only managed two wins, at least two less than any other side in the division, it's no wonder. A return of 10 points from 21 games simply won't cut it, with a points-per-game rate of 0.48 - currently the second worst ever by a team in their WSL debut season.

Palace are the third team to only manage a one-year stint in the WSL - which introduced relegation in 2014 - behind Doncaster Belles (2016) and Bristol City (2024).

Liverpool, who clinched the Championship title in 2022 and are now considered a stable top-flight outfit, might be considered a wise model to follow if Palace plan to pull off an immediate return.

Brighton the surprise act

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of the Women's Super League match between Brighton and Arsenal

Most seasons throw up a surprise act and this year's has been Brighton.

They were tipped to be relegated ahead of a ball being kicked, with Opta making them favourites to go down (26.6 per cent). Fast forward to now and they are as good as assured of fifth place. Stick that in your supercomputer and smoke it!

Dario Vidosic joined as head coach from Melbourne City in the summer and has been somewhat of a revelation, while experienced campaigners Fran Kirby and Nikita Parris have both been a joy to watch in a team that favours expansive, possession-based football.

The year Manchester changed colour?

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights from the Women's Super League match between Manchester United and Manchester City.

City have long been conquerers of Manchester. They are the club closest in major trophy count to Chelsea (seven) over the past decade, albeit some way off the supreme Blues overall.

But this has been an eventful year for all the wrong reasons. Injuries have ravaged their best talents - including Bunny Shaw, Lauren Hemp, Alex Greenwood, Viv Miedema and most recently Mary Fowler.

Nick Cushing was placed in interim charge in March following Taylor's dismissal - the club citing performance-related reasons - but the move has not had the desired affect. An argument might be made for circumstances actually worsening.

They lost at home in the Manchester derby for the first time in their history. They were dumped out of three separate competitions by Chelsea in the same 12-day period. And have missed out on European qualification too, surrendering their place to United, of all teams.

Comparing this season at the same stage to last, City have the biggest negative differential between points won of any side (-12, 52 vs 40). A summer reset cannot come soon enough.

Progress in Europe

Image: Arsenal roared back to beat Lyon 5-3 on aggregate to reach the Champions League final

While the manner of Chelsea's semi-final defeat to Barcelona - an 8-2 demolition job over two legs - may have taken the shine off things, it's clear the gap in class between the WSL's best and Europe's elite is beginning to narrow.

This year's final four contained two English sides for only the third time (also 2017-18 and 2022-23). Arsenal are of course finalists, swatting aside eight-time champions Lyon. It's their first crack at European glory for 18 years.

Holders Barca, meanwhile, will compete in the showpiece game in Lisbon for a fifth year in a row and remain hot favourites. Still, Arsenal under Slegers are a different proposition - a much more complete team. And let's not forget they have pedigree of their own.

Perhaps this is the year the WSL finally shows Europe its might.

The Nerazzurri reached their second final in three season, after losing the 2023 edition in the 1-0 final against Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, and they have the chance to win their fourth ever Champions League trophy, after winning the last one in 2010 under Jose Mourinho at the end of the historical season when Inter won the treble. PSG, on the other side, are yet to win their first Champions League trophy, and they will play their second ever final of the tournament after losing 1-0 in the 2020 edition against Bayern Munich with the deciding goal scored by Kingsley Coman.

The team coached by Luis Enrique were able to reach the final after knocking out Arsenal in the two-legged semifinals, as the French giants won 1-0 in London before winning 2-1 the return leg in Paris on Wednesday, thanks to the goals scored by Fabian Ruiz and former Inter winger Achraf Hakimi. The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, managed to eliminate Barcelona in the semifinals after knocking out Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals, as Simone Inzaghi's side played one of the most memorable Champions League ties in the history of the game, and at the end managed to win 4-3 the return leg with the winning goal scored by Davide Frattesi after drawing 3-3 in Barcelona in the first game. Both sides are full of talents and players that can decide the final at any moment, but let's take a look at the top five players that will feature in the Champions League final this season:

5. GK Yann Sommer, Inter

It wasn't easy to pick the best goalkeeper, especially considering the incredible performances of PSG player Gianluigi Donnarumma against Liverpool in the round of 16 and then in the quarterfinals against Aston Villa. Yann Sommer been absolutely impressive, especially in the first leg of the Arsenal matchup in London. However, the Swiss goalkeeper showed out, especially against Barcelona in the two-legged semifinals, proving he is one of the best players around Europe. His incredible saves, in particular the one on Lamine Yamal at San Siro in the second leg played in Milan, showed why Inter decided to sign him to replace Andre Onana in the summer of 2023.

4. Achraf Hakimi, PSG

The PSG winger played for the Italian side during the 2020-21 season under Antonio Conte, when he was the Inter manager. His impact in the Italian Serie A was outstanding, and his performances led the Nerazzurri to win their first Scudetto in 11 years before PSG decided to sign him in the summer of 2021 for around $70 million, add-ons included. The Nerazzurri, after his departure, replaced him with Dutch winger Denzel Dumfries, who improved a lot and he's now close to the level of Achraf Hakimi, but still not quite there. The Moroccan star can be considered as one of the best players around the world, and he will have the chance to lift the trophy in front of his former teammates and fans after scoring the deciding goal of the semifinals tie against Arsenal in Paris.

3. Lautaro Martinez, Inter

The Inter captain has been incredible this season, and he also showed why last year as he was named seventh in voting for the Ballon d'Or. Winning the Champions League would be the only trophy he still hasn't won so far in his career, and his quick recovery ahead of the second leg of the semifinals against Barcelona showed how much he wants to achieve it, starting six days after suffering a muscular injury in the match played in Barcelona. Compared to the 2023 final against Manchester City, when he was playing alongside Edin Dzeko and Romelu Lukaku, his new teammate, Marcus Thuram, has helped Lautaro Martinez to improve his goal records and performances.

2. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, PSG

Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG has been by far the best signing of the 2025 January transfer window and possibly one of the best ever made in the winter transfer session. The former Napoli winger has been able to prove himself in a very short time in France as well, and since he joined Luis Enrique's team, he scored four goals and provided six assists, but most notably, he was able to show all his talent and quickly gained a starting place in the team. He will be the most talented player on both teams in that game, and he's the one to watch for individual brilliance.

1. Ousmane Dembele, PSG

There is one PSG with Ousmane Dembele on the pitch, and there is one without him. If the French winger will be fit at the best of his form in the 2025 final, there is no much Inter can do to contain him, even if the the Nerazzurri were able to face both Lamine Yamal and Raphinha in the semifinals. His numbers this season are absolutely incredible as he already scored 33 goals, 13 assists and has scored one goal every 92 minutes played over the 44 games in all competitions. A potential Ballon d'Or winner, if he also win the Champions League final on May 31.",cbssports.com,2025-05-08T00:31:21.000000Z,https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ranking-the-five-best-players-of-2025-uefa-champions-league-final-lautaro-martinez-ousmane-dembele-and-more/,1.0

Why the final league phase match should matter to most teams in the UCL (2:44)

Open Extended Reactions

The pots for Thursday's UEFA Champions League draw have been finalised after the playoff round was completed on Wednesday.

It will be the first time a draw takes place under the new format, which sees all 36 teams in one league table.

The draw will begin at 5 p.m. UK / midday ET, with the first fixtures scheduled for Sept. 17-19. The league phase will stretch into January, with all 18 games on the final matchday being played at the same time.

Rather than placing teams into groups, the draw will create eight fixtures for each club. There will be two matches, one at home and one away, against teams from each of the four pots.

As teams now play games against clubs from their own pot there is no benefit from being in Pot 1. In previous seasons, being in Pot 1 meant you would avoid playing matches against the strongest clubs in the tournament.

Pot 1 used to house the holders of the Champions League and Europa League, plus the champions of the top six domestic leagues. Pots 2 through 4 would then be ordered by strength based on UEFA's club coefficient, which ranks clubs on performance in Europe over the previous five seasons. Now only the Champions League titleholders will be automatically in Pot 1, all other positions will be on the UEFA club coefficient.

While clubs will learn their opponents and venues on Thursday, the order of the fixtures will not be published by UEFA until Saturday.

This season the final will be held at the Allianz Arena in Munich on Saturday, May 31.

Champions League has finished its sixth matchweek of the League Phase, with the final games of 2024, including some high profile matches such as Borussia Dortmund - Barcelona, Juventus - Manchester City or Arsenal - Monaco.

Barcelona beat BVB 3-2 in an intense match that secures Barcelona's place in the top eight, currently second just behind Liverpool and the only team with 15 points. Borussia is left outside of the top 8 (9th) and tied with Bayern Munich (10th) with the same points (12) and goal average (9).

The rest of the top 8, that gets direct qualification to the round of 16, has 13 points. That includes Arsenal (3rd), which beat Monaco (16th) 3-0, making the Monegasque team, one of the early sensations of the tournament, fall to the middle of the table after two consecutive defeats.

It also includes another surprise of the season: Lille Olympique Sporting Club (8th), which beat Sturm 3-2, almost securing their elimination (the Austrian Bundesliga leader is 29th in the charts).

Bad news for PSG (25th) despite winning yesterday, as Feyenoord (18th) beat Sparta Praha 4-2 and jumped positions, once again kicking the Parisian club out of the top 24.

Stuttgart (26th) thrashing Young Boys 5-1 also threatens PSG, as that puts them with the same amount of points, 7, and with a direct clash in January between the German and French clubs that could be decisive.

And then there's Manchester City. Third Champions League match without a victory leaves them 22nd, with the same points as Dinamo Zagreb or PSV (which, thankfully for Guardiola, tied and lost this week). PSG welcomes Manchester City on January 22: if one of them loosses, qualification for the knockout phase will be very tight...

3eee5a28-60cd-402a-b3bf-b7da87c38501,"Champions League final chaos 'fantastic wake-up call', says Paris Olympics chief","Problems during the 2022 Champions League final were a ""fantastic wake-up call"" to Paris Olympics organisers and lessons have been learned, the boss of this summer's Games has told Sky News.

A UEFA investigation highlighted significant issues with logistics for crowds around the Stade de France and criticised French authorities for deflecting responsibility for chaos that led to Liverpool fans being crushed.

The stadium on the outskirts of Paris is the centrepiece venue for the Olympics and Paralympics, with athletics events and ceremonies being staged there.

Half a million spectators from Britain are expected at the Olympics - the biggest foreign source of ticket sales - and they are being assured it will be safe with just under six months to go.

Paris 2024 CEO Etienne Thobois told Sky News: ""I think we've all learned a lot from that (Champions League final) and we want to make sure that this never happens again. And that's not just for the Olympics and Paralympics, but that's throughout. It was a fantastic wake up call.

""The fact that it was late planning, we only got the competition (three) months out, there was a lack of coordination.

""It's no excuse, but I can say that now with planning with all the authorities, everybody knows what he has to do.""

The lack of major issues at the Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France last year provided reassurance to Games organisers.

""We also know the Olympics are different,"" Mr Thobois said. ""But I can tell you we have learned a lot from these unfortunate incidents (at the Champions League final) and I can tell you that that is not going to happen here during the Paris 2024 Olympics.""

One of the major security challenges for the Olympics is having the opening ceremony through the heart of Paris to flaunt the landmarks rather than the typical stadium setting.

Athletes will parade on boats on the River Seine and hundreds of thousands of spectators are expected to line the route, and one of the largest security operations in French history will be in place for the Games.

""That will work only if we can secure and deliver in a safe environment,"" Mr Thobois said. ""And that's what we're working on every day. There's been an unprecedented level of planning.""

But with war raging in the Middle East on multiple fronts, is sticking with such an open-air ceremony a risk?

""We will not take chances... we never put anything at risk,"" Mr Thobois said.

Pointing out that the Olympics usually takes place with conflicts going on, he added: ""From the outset you know that you need to secure and deliver a safe environment for people to enjoy and to be able to party and that is no exception.

""So from the start, we looked again at every building, every square metre to again to make sure that we can deliver this fantastic celebration of athletes, of sport, of culture in a secure and safe way.""

One pressing domestic issue for the Olympics and Paralympics is the spectre of worker activism.

As Mr Thobois was speaking to Sky News during a trip to London, Paris was encircled by farmers protesting on tractors to highlight grievances over the future of their industry.

Moves are under way to attempt to placate unions, with French police working on the Olympics and Paralympics offered bonuses of up to €1,900 (£1,622).

It follows days of protests and work stoppages earlier this month in a push for better pay and conditions.

Mr Thobois said: ""We have a very good relationship with the unions and I think it's quite clear that the Olympic and Paralympic Games are not a target for these unions... and actually, on the contrary, everybody is really proud of welcoming the world and showing what France has to offer.""

Asked if he still fears being held to ransom by trade unions, Mr Thobois replied: ""I don't think so and if you look at the past, we've hosted the Rugby World Cup (last year), we hosted big sporting events and that hasn't happening in the past and I don't think it will happen this year.""",news.sky.com,2024-01-30T21:14:00.000000Z,https://news.sky.com/story/champions-league-final-chaos-fantastic-wake-up-call-says-paris-olympics-chief-13060291,0.75

Mikel Arteta's Arsenal are all set to welcome Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg of the UFA Champions League quarterfinal match. Bukayo Saka, who recently returned from injury, could be given a start in the playing XI with the Gunners' boss showing confidence on the England forward.

With the Premier League title all but out of gasp, the Gunners now target the Champions League title by knocking out the defending champions. Mikel Arteta’s men are no pushovers either, after the group stage in third place.

Arsenal’s progression to this stage had been their strong back line, which has conceded just three times throughout the league stage. A relatively easy draw in the Round of 16 round saw them thrash PSV 9-3 across two legs, but they are now against the 13-time UCL winner Real Madrid.

The Los Blancos will enter the fixture with a 1-2 loss against Valencia in La Liga, which has further widened the gap between them and Barcelona. Their journey in the continental tournament hasn’t been smooth either, as they needed penalties and a controversial decision to scrap Julian Alvarez’s spot kick to overcome Atletico Madrid in the last round.

However, Carlo Ancelotti’s men have never exited the Champions League at the quarter-final stage since 2003-04, winning their last 12 bouts at this stage. However, Arsenal will be confident going into Tuesday’s must-win clash.

Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies coach Jerry Tshabalala believes his team has what it takes to go all the way in the CAF Women’s Champions League.

Banyana Ba Style, who are the defending champions of the competition having won it last year, lost 1-0 to FC Masar of Egypt in their first match, but they bounced back in style on Wednesday, hammering CBE 4-0 to keep their hopes of reaching the semifinals alive.

A brace from Melinda Kgadiete and a goal each for Boitumelo Rabale and Lelona Daweti earned Sundowns a comfortable win over the Ethiopian side.

Despite his team scoring four goals in the match, Tshabalala was not happy with his team’s finishing saying they could have scored more.

”It was important for us to bounce back strongly. We started the tournament on a negative note, so we needed to redeem ourselves today and credit the girls for the performance. As much as we scored about four goals, there are still a few things that I believe I am not happy with, I think we should have scored more than four goals in this match. I still believe there’s room for improvement in the team,” said Tshabalala.

”First game was very difficult, I think we should have wrapped it up in the first half and we didn’t do that. But we are a strong team and believe we will go to the semi-final, and for us to be champions we want to beat everyone, it doesn’t matter which team, we have got to beat all the teams that are here in the tournament,” added Tshabalala.

Sundowns are currently third in Group B with three points, one point behind joint leaders Edo Queens and FC Masar, who played to a goalless draw in the other Group B match on Wednesday. CBE are last with no points.

They next face Edo Queens while FC Masar will play bottom-placed and winless CBE in the final group matches.

b39a675b-2cbc-47fb-a9ec-697561775f1e,Champions League: Barca prodigy Yamal puts Messi and Ronaldo to shame,"Lamine Yamal is already a household name at 17. Last night’s performance in the Champions League has drawn insane comparisons to Messi and Ronaldo.

Yamal stars on a crazy night in the UEFA Champions League

When Marcus Thuram nonchalantly backheeled Inter Milan into the lead after 30 seconds of their Champions League semi-final first leg away to Barcelona, the watching world knew they were about to witness something special. The tie ended 3-3, with Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal stealing the show with yet another virtuoso display on the grandest stage in club football. The 17-year-old was already making his 100th appearance for FC Barcelona; he’s now scored 22 times and made 33 assists for the Catalan giants. Already looking like a complete attacker, the inverted right-winger has six goals and 14 assists in 30 LaLiga appearances in 2024-2025. This season’s Champions League has also been his playground. The astonishingly gifted left footer has five goals and four assists from 12 outings in the elite competition. He is now the youngster player ever to score in a Champions League semi-final.

Already a winner with Spain, can he eclipse Messi and Ronaldo?

To put this absurdly talented youngster’s numbers into perspective, let’s stack them up against two of the greats. What were Messi and Ronaldo doing when they were 17? Cristiano Ronaldo had only made 19 appearances with five goals and four assists. Lionel Messi only had NINE senior appearances under his belt with a solitary goal and no assists. Both of those men enjoyed freakish longevity. Ronaldo was an especially late bloomer, but the early signs already indicate that Yamal can become the best footballer of his generation. His stunning solo effort against Inter, as well as his screamer in the Euro 2024 semi-final for Spain against France, are proof that the BMT is there. Yamal and La Roja went all the way. If Barca go to the Champions League final, their opponents will need a master plan to somehow contain the best teenage talent on the planet.

c04ca27d-a579-4e71-8025-1b0414f58e78,Manchester City ‘at risk’ of missing Champions League,"Manchester City are at risk of missing out on next season’s Champions League thanks to their recent dip in form, manager Pep Guardiola said.

City, who are looking to qualify for Europe’s top club competition for a 15th straight season, have won just one of their last eight Premier League games and are seventh in the table, 12 points behind leaders Liverpool.

Only Arsenal between 1998 and 2017, and Manchester United between 1996 and 2014, have a longer record of qualifying among English clubs.

""Ho, ho, ho Cityzens!"" 🎅 A festive message from our players 👇 — Manchester City (@ManCity) December 25, 2024

Guardiola’s side are four points behind Nottingham Forest, who occupy the fourth and final Champions League qualification berth at Christmas.

“When I said before, people laughed. They said, ‘qualifying for the Champions League is not a big success’. But I know it because it happens with clubs in this country,” Guardiola told reporters ahead of their home match against Everton on Boxing Day.

“They were dominant for many years and after they were many years not qualifying for the Champions League.

“The one team that has been in the Champions League for the past years has been Manchester City. Now we are at risk, of course we are.

“If we don’t qualify it is because we don’t deserve it, because we were not prepared and because we had a lot of problems and didn’t solve them.”

7f99f27c-ff35-4ebe-875a-c24e18545c0a,Real Madrid rests starters in 4-0 rout of relegated Granada with focus on Champions League final,"Hey there, time traveller!

This article was published 11/05/2024 (365 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Real Madrid’s backups eased to 4-0 win at the relegated Granada on Saturday as Carlo Ancelotti rested most of his top players to avoid costly injures before the Champions League final.

Defender Antonio Rudiger was the only first-choice player who Ancelotti started for a Spanish league game that was inconsequential for either side.

Madrid clinched its 36th Spanish league title last weekend. It is now fully focused on the European final against Borussia Dortmund on June 1 in London after eliminating Bayern Munich on Wednesday.

Granada didn’t have much to play for either after Mallorca’s 1-0 win at Las Palmas meant the team from southern Spain was relegated. Granada is in 19th place and joins bottom side Almeria in going to the second division. Cadiz is in danger of becoming the third team to drop.

Little used left back Fran García scored and assisted Turkish teenager Arda Guler in the first half. Brahim Díaz made his case for some playing time in the title game against Dortmund after the creative forward scored two second-half goals.

Thibaut Courtois was back in goal for his second appearance of the season after he recovered from an ACL tear and a knee injury. Ancelotti said on Friday he has yet to decide if Courtois or Andriy Lunin, who has played most of the season, will be his pick against Dortmund.

Luka Modric and Eduardo Camavinga, players with real chances to see minutes in the Champions League final, also started.

“My goal is to arrive to the final with the entire team in peak form, and I think we will do that,” Ancelotti said.

Ancelotti and Madrid players will celebrate their league title with supporters in central Madrid on Sunday.

ATHLETIC HELD

Fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao needed an added-time goal against visiting Osasuna to salvage a 2-2 draw, dropping points in its fight for a top-four finish and Champions League berth.

The Copa del Rey champion was five points behind fourth-placed Atletico Madrid before it hosts Celta Vigo on Sunday.

Asier Villalibre equalized for Athletic on one of the last kicks of the game when Osasuna goakeeper Sergio Herrera spilled a cross after colliding with a teammate.

The victory kept alive Villarreal’s chances of catching Real Betis in seventh place and the Europa Conference League spot.
