Even with a lot of major title races already decided (or close to it), the month of May is a legitimate roller coaster: We have the semis and finals of UEFA's three continental tournaments, major cup finals, fights over Champions League spots for next season, desperate promotion and relegation plot twists, minor league title chases and the glory that is final-matchday whip-around coverage.

Egyptian giants stand in the way of Orlando Pirates, Sundowns

The eventual winners of this season’s Caf Champions League will take home $4 million (R75 million). That number has grown from $2.5 million in 2022. Orlando Pirates must negotiate a tough second-leg semi-final clash in Egypt against Pyramids after a hard-fought 0-0 draw in the first leg. If they advance to the final, either Mamelodi Sundowns or defending champions Al Ahly await them in another two-legged affair to crown the continent’s finest side. Sundowns meet Al Ahly on Friday, 25 April at 18:00 after a goalless first leg. Pyramids vs Pirates kicks off at 20:00 on the same day. What a feast of football.

Mofokeng will be key

Relebohile Mofokeng has racked up a staggering 41 appearances in the 2024-2025 season across all competitions. Arguably the club’s most important operator, he’s produced 10 goals and 13 assists in those matches. It’s a stellar output for any player, let alone one who’s just exited his teens. Is there a succession plan for when he inevitably leaves for a wealthier league abroad? Money can buy good players, but some stars are priceless. Pirates have unearthed a new teenager, but he’s unlikely to make an impact for some time.

Open Extended Reactions

Carlo Ancelotti has said Real Madrid are ""in Champions League mode"" ahead of their final clash with Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on Saturday.

Madrid played their last LaLiga game of the season on Saturday -- a 0-0 draw with Real Betis -- having wrapped up the league title weeks earlier, and now have a week to prepare for the Champions League final.

The Spanish giants are the most successful team in European Cup history, winning the competition 14 times, including five in the last decade.

""The cold sweat arrives on Saturday afternoon,"" Ancelotti said at Madrid's pre-final media day at their Valdebebas training ground.

""The fear, that's normal. I have experience. My team gives me confidence and hope. They look focused on the game. They're in Champions League mode.""

Ancelotti's teams have reached nine European Cup finals -- three as a player, and six as a manager -- and he is now hoping to land his second Champions League since returning to Madrid in 2021 for his second spell as coach.

""It's always the same ahead of these games,"" he said. ""Excitement, happiness, being involved in the most important game of the season... We're not on holiday yet, and the other teams are. They'll see the game on TV.""

Ancelotti refused to confirm that back-from-injury Thibaut Courtois would start the final in goal, ahead of Andriy Lunin, as ESPN has reported.

""It's very difficult,"" Ancelotti said. ""Of course it's really difficult, because both of them deserve to play this final. Lunin has had a fantastic season, Courtois is back from his injury.""

""One of the two is going to play,"" he added, laughing, ""and the other will be on the bench.""

The Italian coach said midfielder Toni Kroos -- who announced his retirement last week -- doesn't need another trophy to be remembered as a club legend.

""Let's hope he can end his career with the Champions League, he deserves it,"" Ancelotti said. ""He's gone down in Real Madrid history, he's already there, but ending with a Champions League would be fantastic.""",espn.co.uk,2024-05-27T15:57:45.000000Z,https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/40227489/ancelotti-says-real-madrid-champions-league-final-mode

SEOUL, April 23 (Yonhap) -- Having bagged a crucial win at home, South Korean champions Ulsan HD FC will now visit Japanese foes Yokohama F. Marinos this week as they chase their first Asian club football title in four years.

Ulsan and Yokohama will square off in the second leg of the semifinals of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Yokohama International Stadium in Yokohama, Japan.

Ulsan won the opening leg last week at home by 1-0, with midfielder Lee Dong-gyeong's 19th-minute goal providing the difference.

Ulsan just need to avoid a loss Wednesday, and they will punch their ticket to the two-legged final next month. The away goals rule is no longer in effect, and extra time and a penalty shootout will be used to determine the winner if necessary.

For the knockouts, teams have been split into East and West regions. Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates defeated Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia 4-2 in the first leg of the semifinals in the West Region last week, with their return leg set for Tuesday night in Riyadh.

Ulsan have won two AFC Champions League titles, most recently in 2020, when they defeated the Iranian side Persepolis 2-1 in the one-and-done final match.

They have since collected two domestic trophies, winning the K League 1 titles in 2022 and 2023. And their ""three-peat"" bid is off to a solid start this year, as they rank third with 14 points, three back of the league-leading Pohang Steelers but with one match in hand. Ulsan lead all clubs with 16 goals in seven matches.

Lee Dong-gyeong has been involved in 10 of those goals, with six goals and a league-best four assists. He was the lone goal scorer in last week's win, and Ulsan will look to other attackers to step up their game.

Forward Joo Min-kyu netted three goals in the round of 16 but has been held off the scoresheet since. The two-time K League 1 scoring champion is a threat to go off at any moment, though.

Ulsan's Hungarian forward Martin Adam leads Ulsan with five goals for this year's Champions League, but all five came during the group stage.

At the other end, goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo has been sharp in the knockout stage, having conceded only two goals in five matches.

UEFA, also inspired by the NFL's Super Bowl halftime show, has had limited success with incorporating music acts into its showpiece event.

Inter Milan looked firmly in control early on, racing to a 2-0 lead with a quick double one of which came from Denzel Dumfries, who was in inspired form. But the Italian side’s dominance was short-lived, as teenage sensation Lamine Yamal sparked a spirited Barcelona comeback.

He nearly doubled his tally with a dazzling solo run, only for his effort to be pushed onto the bar by Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Ferran Torres later brought Barcelona level just before halftime.

The second half saw more drama unfold, with Dumfries striking again to put Inter ahead in the 63rd minute. But Barcelona refused to bow out. This time it was Raphinha who answered the call his powerful strike from distance took a deflection off Sommer and found the back of the net to make it 3-3.

The Angolan spoke to The South African before the draw for the continental league. The former Cape Town City FC shot-stopper said he was longing for a dance with the Tshwane giants.

Why the CAF Champions League finest wants Sundowns

The South African then asked the former Angolan international how far he thinks Petro de Luanda can go in this CAF Champions League race. In reply, Hugo Marques quoted the motto of the African Football League winners, saying: “The sky is the limit. I just want Sundowns in the final.”

Hugo Marques was a revelation in this CAF Champions League group stages. He kept clean sheets in all six matches as Petro de Luanda qualified for the quarterfinals. The clean-shaven custodian attributed his rich vein of form to teamwork. He said: “Teamwork. I have the best defenders in Africa. Pedro Pinto, Inacio Miguel, Kinito, Anderson, Eddi Afonso, Vidinho and To Carneiro.” He further expressed his admiration for Sundowns keeper Ronwen Williams, describing him as the best on the continent.

CAF Champions League star reveals secret amid Sundowns wish

His comments come amid excitement following the CAF Champions League quarterfinal line-up. The draw held on Tuesday saw the Angolans pitied against TP Mazembe, whereas the DStv Premiership invincible date Young Africans (Yanga). The other ties have Al Ahly taking on Simba SC, whereas Esperance Sportive de Tunis meets Asec Mimosa. First-leg quarterfinal matches are scheduled for the weekend of March 29 and 30, 2024. Second-leg quarterfinal games will take place on the weekend of April 5 and 6, 2024, according to CAF. Al Ahly are the defending champions.

How Hugo Marques fared at Cape Town City

Hugo Marques impressed when he featured in 34 matches for Cape Town City. Little wonder he was voted the DStv Premiership’s best keeper in the 2021-2022 season. However, he took many by surprise in South African football circles when he requested the management of the Citizens to release him from his contract in August 2022. His deal with the Cape Town-based outfit was then set to end the following year in June.

Recoup of the Angolan’s time in DStv Premiership

Now back home, the Angolan has since re-established himself as one of the best keepers in the Girabola league, and the CAF Champions League. The veteran player has always relished meetings against Sundowns as such games remind him of his DStv Premiership spell. The Pretoria-based side last met the Angolans on October 21, 2023. The Rulani Mokwena-led outfit won the quarterfinal first-leg 2-0 before completing the job three days later with a goalless draw in the reverse fixture.",thesouthafrican.com,2024-03-13T10:21:46.000000Z,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/sport/soccer/petro-de-luanda-goalkeeper-hugo-marques-has-expressed-his-wish-to-meet-mamelodi-sundowns-in-the-caf-champions-league-final/
28aaaba2-c6fa-4aab-8f8f-928512cdbd2d,Europe’s heavyweights await Champions League quarter-final fate,"PARIS: This Friday’s Champions League quarter-final draw is set to throw up a series of heavyweight ties after a midweek in which penalty shoot-out drama really brought Europe’s elite club competition to life.

Goalkeeper Jan Oblak’s heroics in Atletico Madrid’s shoot-out win over last season’s runners-up Inter Milan on Wednesday — after the Spanish club came from behind in their last-16 tie — followed Arsenal’s triumph on penalties against Porto a day earlier.

Tuesday also saw Barcelona deliver a rousing performance to see off Napoli and make it through to the quarter-finals for the first time since their 8-2 annihilation at the hands of Bayern Munich in 2020 in Lisbon, at the height of the Covid crisis.

With record 14-time champions Real Madrid already having secured their last-eight berth, it means three Spanish clubs will be represented in the draw.

They are joined by two English sides in Arsenal and holders Manchester City, as well as the German duo of Bayern and Borussia Dortmund, and French giants Paris St Germain.

The surprise is that none of Italy’s representatives reached the next stage, a year after Inter pushed City close in the final having eliminated neighbours AC Milan in the last four.

Only three of last season’s quarter-finalists — City, Real and Bayern — have made it back to the last eight this time, suggesting there is still a real degree of variety and unpredictability to the competition.

Yet the recent last-16 ties also more than hinted at the ever-growing polarisation at the very top of European football.

FC Copenhagen could never really compete with Pep Guardiola’s City, while getting the better of PSG proved a step too far for Real Sociedad and Bayern ultimately brushed aside Lazio despite losing the first leg away.

Only the mega-rich can now aspire to winning the Champions League, with four of the quarter-finalists posting revenue last season of over 800 million euros ($874m) according to this year’s Deloitte Football Money League.

Going by Deloitte’s ranking, all eight quarter-finalists were in the top 15 clubs in the world last season in terms of income — Atletico had the lowest at just over 364 million euros.

Diego Simeone’s side were the only team to win against a richer club in the last 16, and even then Inter generated only marginally more money last season.

The current format of the Champions League has been in place for two decades and will be changed for next season, when UEFA will revolutionise its flagship tournament by replacing the group stage with a league phase featuring 36 clubs, up from 32 now.

Clubs will play eight games in the league phase, instead of six in the old group stage, all against different opponents in what is known as the “Swiss system”.

It remains to be seen if that will somehow improve the Champions League, when the major issue appears to be that the number of candidates to win the trophy is getting narrower.

Competing with City is not just an issue for Copenhagen, but for all clubs.

Having won the trophy for the first time last season, they are into the quarter-finals for the seventh year running.

Whether anyone can prevent them retaining the title may in large part come down to the draw, with the path to the final being determined on Friday when the semi-final match-ups will also be decided.

Winners in 2022, Real may be the best equipped to beat City among all the sides left in the quarter-finals, but they were blown away by them in last season’s semi-finals.

Bayern are into the quarter-finals for the 12th time in 13 years. They may be trailing behind Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga, but they remain a formidable prospect in Europe.

Three of the remaining contenders have never won the trophy, in Arsenal, Atletico and PSG, the French side reaching the final in 2020, when they lost to Bayern.

They are far from a complete team now, but will be eager to seize their last chance to win the Champions League before Kylian Mbappe departs.
