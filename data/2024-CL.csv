Egyptian giants stand in the way of Orlando Pirates, Sundowns

The eventual winners of this season’s Caf Champions League will take home $4 million (R75 million). That number has grown from $2.5 million in 2022. Orlando Pirates must negotiate a tough second-leg semi-final clash in Egypt against Pyramids after a hard-fought 0-0 draw in the first leg. If they advance to the final, either Mamelodi Sundowns or defending champions Al Ahly await them in another two-legged affair to crown the continent’s finest side. Sundowns meet Al Ahly on Friday, 25 April at 18:00 after a goalless first leg. Pyramids vs Pirates kicks off at 20:00 on the same day. What a feast of football.

Mofokeng will be key

Relebohile Mofokeng has racked up a staggering 41 appearances in the 2024-2025 season across all competitions. Arguably the club’s most important operator, he’s produced 10 goals and 13 assists in those matches. It’s a stellar output for any player, let alone one who’s just exited his teens. Is there a succession plan for when he inevitably leaves for a wealthier league abroad? Money can buy good players, but some stars are priceless. Pirates have unearthed a new teenager, but he’s unlikely to make an impact for some time.

f5d6e318-de65-4a6e-b615-89089292920a,Lloris reveals strange gesture from Tottenham chairman before 2019 Champions League final,"Former Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris says that players received a watch engraved with “Champions League finalist” from chairman Daniel Levy before their loss to Liverpool.

The Frenchman admits the gesture left him questioning whether the club truly prioritised winning.

During his 12-year tenure with Tottenham, much of it as captain, Lloris saw the club come close to success but fall short in key moments, including two League Cup final defeats and a loss in the 2019 Champions League final.

In that game, Liverpool’s early lead came after a controversial penalty, with Lloris conceding from the spot due to a handball by teammate Moussa Sissoko.

However, Lloris recalls being unsettled before the final even started.

Levy gathered the team just days before to present them with engraved watches, which the goalkeeper felt betrayed a complacency with second place rather than striving for victory.

In his forthcoming autobiography, ‘Earning My Spurs’, Lloris shares his frustration with the gesture.

He said: “Four days before the final, Daniel Levy called us all together to announce that, with the support of a sponsor, we would each receive a luxury aviator watch from the club.

“At first, we were excited to see the elegant boxes.

🚨 NEW: Hugo Lloris revealed that Daniel Levy met with the players 4 days before the Champions League Final in 2019 that they would be receiving a luxury aviator watch from the club. The back of the watches were engraved with ‘Champions League Finalist 2019.’ Embarrassing. pic.twitter.com/gnUJF7hyWg — Spurs Connect (@Spurs_Connect) November 7, 2024

“Then we opened them and discovered that he’d had the back of each timepiece engraved with the player’s name and ‘Champions League Finalist 2019.’ ‘Finalist.’

“Who does such a thing at a moment like this? I still haven’t got over it, and I’m not alone.

“If we’d won, he wouldn’t have asked for the watches back to have ‘Winner’ engraved instead.

“I would have preferred there to be nothing on it. With an engraving like that, Levy couldn’t have been surprised if we had been 1–0 down after a couple of minutes: so it was written.”

Reflecting on the post-match reception, Lloris was disappointed by what he perceived as a lack of seriousness among some club officials and players following the defeat.

He added: “I would have liked people to come up to me and say, ‘Don’t worry, Hugo. Never again. We’ll give you the means for a comeback.’

“But when I returned to my room on the night of the final, I think I had the same feeling as Mauricio [Pochettino] and Harry [Kane]: does the club really want to win?

“Real Madrid would never have celebrated a lost final, and we shouldn’t have either.”

Lloris made his final Spurs appearance in April 2023 and later joined Los Angeles FC. He is also France’s most-capped male footballer.",101greatgoals.com,2024-11-07T13:19:02.000000Z,https://www.101greatgoals.com/football/premier-league/lloris-reveals-strange-gesture-from-tottenham-chairman-before-2019-champions-league-final/
bcd02aef-aad6-42a7-b2d2-a1ac008b1589,"Final derby at Goodison, trip to City & Champions League draw","Liverpool have yet another busy month to navigate and one that will tell us plenty about their silverware hopes for 2024/25, with a possible seven games across three competitions.

Arne Slot‘s side experienced a few blips in January, losing twice and drawing once across in nine games across all competitions – though they remain top of the Premier League and Champions League.

There was progression in the FA Cup, but the Reds do have a deficit to overturn if they are to send us to Wembley for yet another Carabao Cup final.

The deciding leg is one match in another busy month that will be full of nerves for those of us watching on.

February 6 – Tottenham (H)

February starts with the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg, and there is a one-goal deficit to overturn at Anfield against a side who are consistently inconsistent.

Spurs have been decimated by injury this season but have started to welcome back a few faces ahead of the decider – which will give them a boost as they continue to languish 14th in the league table.

There is no guarantee, but Liverpool ought to feel comfortable getting the job done.

February 9 – Plymouth (A)

Rotation will then again be on the cards for yet another trip to the south coast, this time to meet Championship cellar dwellers Plymouth in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

They sit 24th in the Championship with 25 points and recently sold one of their joint-top goalscorers, making this a valuable chance to give more minutes to those on the fringe.

We would not be surprised to see a team that is not too dissimilar to the one that faced PSV in the Champions League.

February 12 – Everton (A)

The final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park then awaits, which is our game in hand after the initial fixture was postponed due to Storm Darragh in early December.

An evening kickoff will only lift the atmosphere, one that has already been boosted by the return of David Moyes and three successive victories in the league – trust us to have to play them now!

This is a huge fixture and one that would establish a nine-point gap at the top after 24 games.

February 16 – Wolves (H)

The fixture list does not relent, as days later the Reds will welcome Wolves to Anfield – this time with a different manager to whom they faced in the reverse fixture in September.

Gary O’Neil was replaced by Vitor Pereira in December and he has since overseen four wins from nine games (at the time of writing), still leaving them in the mix for relegation.

This is the second of only three home fixtures this month.

February 19 – Aston Villa (A) *

This fixture is not yet locked in for this date as it all rests on if Liverpool progress to the Carabao Cup final.

If Slot’s side secure their place at Wembley, they lose a free midweek as this league fixture needs to be moved from the weekend of the final (March 15/16) to the only guaranteed free spot in the schedule.

However, if Liverpool do not overturn their deficit to Tottenham, this match will be played on March 15. The joys of being successful in so many competitions, eh!

February 21 – Champions League last 16 draw

This is when Liverpool will discover who they will meet in the last 16 of the Champions League, in addition to their possible path to the final as the bracket will be finalised.

Slot’s side will meet either the winner of Brest vs. PSG OR Monaco vs. Benfica – though, we already know the Reds will host the second leg at Anfield.

Not as many unknowns in this new format but at least we can look ahead to who our potential opponents could be in the quarter-final and semi-final.

The ties will be played on March 4/5 and 11/12.

February 23 – Man City (A)

This fixture is not quite the blockbuster as it was anticipated to be considering City’s downfall, but it remains a vital hurdle for Liverpool to clear.

They have not won at the Etihad in the league since 2015 and it is about time that changed, for everyone’s sanity. Three points would be hugely significant in the race for the title.

Notably, City will have travelled to Real Madrid less than four days before this match.

February 26 – Newcastle (H)

To close out the month, Eddie Howe’s Newcastle make the trip to Anfield just days after the battle at City in a late midweek kickoff (8.15pm GMT).

The reverse fixture felt chaotic, to say the least, as Liverpool were just minutes away from a successful comeback win before a late mistake saw the points shared.

Newcastle are battling for a European spot this season and they cannot be another who leave Merseyside with points, not when only six more league home games remain after this one.

In recent years, UEFA has adopted the habit of turning sports into a global spectacle, in the ""American way"", and the Champions League final on May 31, one of the most followed football games of the year, will have a special music show by American rock band Linkin Park.

The band released today a preview of what they will bring to the ""UEFA Champions League Final Kick Off Show by Pepsi"" (sic): a remix of the band's old riffs (like Numb) with ""the sights and sounds of the UEFA Champions League"". Oh boy.

Linkin Park rose to prominence in the early 2000s as an alternative rock band lead by vocalist Chester Bennington, who died by suicide in 2017. But in 2024, the band returned with new vocalist Emily Armstrong, releasing their first album since 2017, From Zero, and kicking off an ongoing worldwide tour.

Germany is witnessing a rise in hotel bookings as the country gears up to host the UEFA Champions League final on 31 May. According to data from SiteMinder, the world’s leading hotel distribution and revenue platform, reservations at local hotels between 29-31 May are currently higher by 32% compared to bookings made over the same period last year.

SiteMinder’s data further reveals that room rates have increased year-on-year in the lead-up to the final at Munich’s Allianz Arena, with the average daily rate (ADR) for stays during the period climbing by 10% to €265, from €241 last year. By contrast, the ADR in the preceding week was €56 lower, highlighting the spike in demand as the final game approaches.

Additionally, shifts in booking windows and lengths of stay reflect the impact of one of the world’s most anticipated football matches: travellers are locking in their stays at local properties earlier by 23 days, with the average booking lead time reaching 136 days, up from 113 days last year. Meanwhile, stays have shortened slightly year-on-year, with guests booking for an average of 1.57 nights, down from 1.83 nights over the same period in 2024.

“We saw during Germany’s hosting of UEFA Euros last year just how positive its impact was on local hotels, and it’s pleasing to see that the Champions League is proving no different, offering valuable momentum at a time when hotels are navigating more complex market dynamics,” says Andreas Kastl, SiteMinder’s Regional Manager – DACH. “With thousands of fans – both local and international – preparing to travel to Germany to see who takes home this year’s trophy, hotels are encouraged to fully embrace dynamic revenue practices that respond quickly to booking demand, whether through pricing or marketing strategies. For instance, longer booking windows give hotels more time to connect with their guests, creating opportunities to upsell and provide exclusive, personalised offers well before visiting fans arrive at the front desk.”

Ahead of the final showdown in Munich, the UEFA Champions League semi-finals will be played over two legs on 29-30 April and 6-7 May, with each of the qualifying teams set to host one match at their respective home stadiums across Europe. The venues will be confirmed following the quarter-final results.

Paris Saint-Germain needs only a tie next week in front of its own supporters at Parc des Princes to advance to the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League final after beating Arsenal 1-0 in Tuesday’s first leg semi in London.

French national team star Ousmane Dembele opened the scoring less than four minutes after kickoff at Emirates Stadium in the English capital. The decisive second match of the two-game, home-and-home, total-goals-wins series will be played on May 7.

Here are a few quick thoughts following Tuesday’s contest.

Play of the game

ADVERTISEMENT

PSG defender Nuno Mendes started the play by finding Dembélé in space in the center of the field. The Frenchman passed to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia streaking down the wing, then continued his run into Arsenal’s penalty area. Kvaratskhelia’s beautiful return ball found Dembélé in strike, and he coolly first-timed his shot past the outstretched arm of Gunners goalkeeper David Raya to stun the home crowd at the Emirates.

Turning point

The hosts appeared to have canceled out Dembélé’s tally just after halftime, when Mikel Merino nodded a Declan Rice free-kick past PSG backstop Gianluigi Donnarumma. Unfortunately for most of those in attendance, the celebration was short-lived, as the video assistant referee determined that Merino had strayed just offside a split-second before Rice’s service.

Key stat

Contrary to popular belief, teams that win games on early goals usually get heavily out-possessed over 90 minutes; as their opponents desperately chase an equalizer, the squad in the lead is happy to absorb pressure and look to inflict the fatal blow via a counterattack.

That wasn’t the case on Tuesday. At one point midway through the first half, PSG had enjoyed the ball for a whopping 68-percent of the proceedings. And they finished the match with more than half of the overall possession – a damning stat for the home side.

What’s next for Paris Saint-Germain?

PSG, which three weeks ago clinched its 11th Ligue 1 title since its deep-pocketed Qatari owners bought the club in 2011, returns to domestic action when they visit Strasbourg on Saturday.

The big one looms three days later, when the Gunners visit the City of Light. PSG has reached the final just once before, in 2020, when Kylian Mbappe, Neymar & Co. fell to Bayern Munich in Lisbon.

What’s next for Arsenal?

Mikel Arteta’s side will return to Premier League action on Saturday versus local rivals Fulham. As is the case for PSG, that match is somewhat anticlimactic since Liverpool sealed the English crown last weekend. The Gunners, who lead third-place Newcastle by five points with four games left, remain in the driver’s seat to finish runner-up for the third consecutive season.

Arteta will no doubt prioritize next week’s rematch, as he should: While PSG deserved its win on Tuesday, they also squandered several golden opportunities to pad their lead. Kvaratskhelia was denied what he insisted should’ve been a penalty kick. Raya denied Desire Doue with an all-world save. Goncalo Ramos rattled the crossbar late in the second half.

If the Gunners score first next week in Paris, neutral fans will be in for a treat.

10b3b68d-1aa5-40a5-8cb3-219091ae560b,Champions League: Uefa re-open bidding for stadiums for 2027 final,"Uefa has reopened the bidding for stadiums to host the 2027 Champions League final, after the match was stripped from Milan.

The San Siro was to be the venue for the showcase final but, after Milan officials failed to assure Uefa that planned redevelopment work would not hamper the event, European football's governing body opted to take it away from them.

AC Milan and Inter Milan are considering building a new stadium in the San Siro area.

The new host stadium for the 2027 final is expected to be announced in May or June 2025.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Uefa Executive Committee on Tuesday, where changes to the organisation's solidarity funding was also agreed.

The 'big five' European leagues - the Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Serie A and Bundesliga - agreed to have their solidarity payments capped at 10m euros (£8.3m) per season up to and including 2026-27.

This is an increase of 1.5m euros on the previous cycle, but there are now 308m euros (£256.3m) to be shared rather than 177.2m euros (£147.4m) in the previous cycle.

The funds are allocated to clubs not participating in European competitions.

""Such funds are meant to support competitive balance across Europe's top division leagues, where some clubs benefit from additional revenue streams due to European competition participation,"" Uefa explained.

At Tuesday's meeting Uefa's women's football strategy for 2024 to 2030 was also agreed, though details of what it entails are yet to be released.",bbc.co.uk,2024-09-24T17:48:30.000000Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgryg9598q1o
0c189bab-ae9a-4fb3-b542-7dc3f9b7e5c4,What does Rangers' Champions League exit mean for finances?,"Governing body Uefa says, external £2.12bn will be distributed to participating Champions League clubs in 2024-25, while Europa League clubs will receive a share of £485m - roughly 22% of the Champions League monies.

Rangers reached the last 16 of the Europa League last season, while Celtic competed in the final group stage of the Champions League.

Both clubs will not reveal their income streams in their accounts for 2023-24 until later this year, but Rangers were a Champions League group-stage club in autumn 2022 and detailed £18.5m in Uefa revenue in that year's accounts.

In the previous year, which related to Rangers' run to the Europa League final, the club received £17.3m in Uefa prize money.

How much of this season's £485m is distributed to Rangers depends on how far they go in the competition and how many points they pick up at the new league phase.

They are guaranteed £3.7m, compared with the near £16m Celtic are guaranteed in the Champions League's new league phase.

A win in any of the eight league-phase games Rangers will play would be worth in the region of £386,000 and a draw £129,000. The Ibrox club will also receive a performance-related amount depending on where they finish at the end of the league phase.

Qualification to the Europa League knockout round is worth £257,000 per club, with £1.5m the prize for progressing to the last 16. The prize money increases to £2.15m in the quarter-finals, £2.6m in the semi-finals, £7m for reaching the final and an additional £6m goes to the winner.

Hence, like Rangers in season 2021-22, it would require a place in the Europa League final to get close to matching Champions League pre-knockout round participation income.",bbc.co.uk,2024-08-14T16:48:38.000000Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c77l86m8pp0o

We are close to knowing the semi-finals for men's Champions League, but before that, Women's Champions League is closing the knockout stages tomorrow, Sunday, April 27. The first leg took place last Sunday, with Olympique de Lyon having a short edge over Arsenal, 2-1... while Barcelona crushed Chelsea 4-1.

It wouldn't be too surprising if the same final from last year repeats: Lyon vs. Barcelona. Barcelona has won the cup twice in a row, 2023 and 2024, and Lyon won it 2022... and seven times before.

Meanwhile, Chelsea only reached the final once (losing to Barcelona in 2021) and Arsenal won it in 2007. Is there room for surprise? Chelsea has a near impossible mission of coming back from three goals down, but Arsenal still has the final in reach... and the possibility is there for Women's Champions League to have the same final as Men's Champions League.

ARKA has recently conducted a study from various online video-sharing and social media platforms to find out the most discussed and viewed Champions League finals.

The most watched Champions League Finals

The study focused on the cumulative view numbers of these finals and the level of social engagement surrounding them. Compiled in May 2024, the data ranks all the finals from the most to the least viewed.

Firstly, the most-watched Champions League final is the 2015 matchup between Juventus and Barcelona, which has 18.2M views. Featuring the attacking trio of Messi, Neymar, and Suárez, contributed significantly to the high viewership, as they led Barcelona to a memorable 3-1 win.

The second most-watched final in the ranking is the 2016 clash between Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, attracting 17.2M viewers. This match earned the majority of its viewership for its dramatic finish in a penalty shootout after Sergio Ramos’ equalizer and Ronaldo’s winning goal in the shootout.

Bronze medal

Furthermore, third place was secured by the 2008 game between Manchester United and Chelsea, which drew 16.7M viewers. The high viewership of this match was driven by key moments such as John Terry’s infamous missed penalty and Cristiano Ronaldo’s early header, crucial for his first Champions League victory.

The fourth most popular final in the list is the 2017 match between Juventus and Real Madrid, attracting 15.3M viewers.

Champions League Finals: The miracle in Istanbul

Additionally, fifth in the ranking is the 2005 clash between AC Milan and Liverpool which gathered 14M views. Known as the “Miracle of Istanbul,” the match’s popularity mostly comes from Liverpool’s dramatic comeback from a three-goal deficit to win on penalties, making it one of the most iconic moments in football history.

To add to that, Chelsea vs Bayern Munich final in 2012 took sixth place, attracting 13.8M views. Furthermore,tThis game is memorable for Chelsea winning their first Champions League trophy in a dramatic penalty shootout, contributing to its high viewership and its place in the ranking.

Liverpool and Tottenham, which drew 11.3M viewers takes seventh. However, Liverpool’s early goal laid the groundwork for their 2-0 win, securing their sixth European title and making it one of the most viewed and discussed finals of the championship.

Rounding out the most watched Champions League Finals

Tied for ninth in viewership, the 2002 and 2014 Champions League finals both featuring Real Madrid attracted 10.4M views. The 2014 match featuring Real Madrid against Atletico Madrid is notable for Sergio Ramos’s late equalizer, which led to a dramatic 4-1 victory after extra time. This win secured Real Madrid their “La Decima” title.

Finally, rounding out the top ten, the 2018 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool attracted 9.7M viewers. The match also featured Real Madrid’s 3-1 victory, highlighted by Gareth Bale’s remarkable overhead kick, which sealed their third consecutive Champions League title.",thesouthafrican.com,2024-06-22T09:43:41.000000Z,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/sport/soccer/the-most-watched-champions-league-finals-in-history/

fae2d00b-846c-4917-8fe5-c19b4b03058c,Champions League 2024/25: Why it matters where each team finishes in the league phase table and the knockout round impact,"We are in the home straight of the new league phase of the Champions League - with the five British teams looking to accomplish different feats in the new format.

Liverpool have won each of their opening seven games and need just one point to be certain of top spot in the standings.

But can Arne Slot now afford to rotate his team in the final game? Not after Barcelona's dramatic 5-4 win against Benfica. Hansi Flick's side are three points behind the Reds but currently hold a superior goal difference.

That is because there is an incentive to keep winning as every single finishing place matters in this new Champions League format.

Read below to see all the permutations regarding the rest of the new Champions League structure and what British teams need to do to qualify...

Champions League - what we know so far Confirmed in round of 16



Liverpool, Barcelona



Confirmed in round of 16 or knockout phase play-offs



Arsenal, Aston Villa, Atalanta, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Brest, Celtic, Dortmund, Feyenoord, Inter Milan, Juventus, Leverkusen, Lille, AC Milan, Monaco, Real Madrid



Confirmed in knockout phase play-offs



None



Eliminated



Bologna, Red Star Belgrade, Girona, Leipzig, Slovan Bratislava, Sparta Prague, Sturm Graz, Young Boys.

What are the permutations for British teams in the final round?

Liverpool have guaranteed their place in the last 16 and will bypass the play-off round.

But, as explained above, they haven't yet secured top spot of the league stage.

Arsenal are all-but through to the last 16 after beating Zagreb.

Although TEN teams will start the final round of group matches within three points of the Gunners, Arsenal's +12 goal difference should be sufficient to see them through even if they lose next week to Girona.

So while Arsenal do still need at least a point to be mathematically certain of progression, only some very dramatic scorelines would demote them out of the top eight.

Arsenal are currently in third place which means, if they stayed in this position, they would face the winners of a play-off match featuring teams in 13th or 14th and 19th or 20th.

The teams currently in those positions are Brest (13th), Borussia Dortmund (14th), PSV Eindhoven (19th) and Club Brugge (20th).

Ninth-placed Aston Villa are one of the 10 teams within three points of Arsenal but such is the congestion that only a win next Wednesday against Celtic will realistically be enough for Unai Emery's side to have any hope of finishing in the top eight.

Celtic's late victory over Young Boys means they will definitely be in the play-offs.

And a win at Villa would give them a chance of reaching the last 16 automatically - although it remains an unlikely prospect even in the event of a victory at Villa Park given there are 10 teams between them and the top eight.

Then there's Manchester City.

Incredibly, Pep Guardiola's team will begin the final round in the relegation zone from the league stage.

Two points and a place below Stuttgart in the top 24, only a victory over Club Brugge will be enough for City to sneak into the play-offs. A win would leave them level on points with Brugge but with a superior goal difference, victory WILL be enough for City to escape the drop zone.

The play-off rounds take place on February 11/12 and February 18/19.

Who could British clubs play next?

There may be some confusion over what this means for your team, so as it stands, let's take a look at what the path for the British teams looks like...

Liverpool (Current seed: 1st)

Knockout playoffs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Bayern Munich (15th), Real Madrid (16th), Juventus (17th) or Celtic (18th)

Arsenal (Current seed: 3rd)

Knockout playoffs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Brest (13th), Dortmund (14th), PSV (19th) or Club Brugge (20th)

Aston Villa (Current seed: 9th)

Knockout playoffs: vs Sporting (23rd) or Stuttgart (24th)

Round of 16: vs Atalanta (7th) or Leverkusen (8th)

Celtic (Current seed: 18th)

Knockout playoffs: vs Bayern Munich (15th) or Real Madrid (16th)

Round of 16: vs Liverpool (1st) or Barcelona (2nd)

Manchester City (Current seed: 25th)

As it stands, Manchester City would be eliminated from European football.

Who qualifies out of the league phase?

To achieve automatic qualification into the round of 16 in March, teams must finish in the top eight.

Those in ninth to 24th enter a round of two-legged play-offs in February, with the winners taking the other eight spots in the last 16.

Those who finish ninth to 16th will be seeded for the play-offs, so will have the second leg at home. Those from 17th to 24th will be unseeded, so have the first leg at home.

Teams that finish anywhere from 25th to 36th will be eliminated from this season's competition, with no access to the Europa League.

Ok, but if we're in the top eight, does it matter if I finish first or eighth?

Yes, it does. The way the Champions League league phase works is the final league position gives you a specific route - and specific opponents - in the knockout stage draw.

The below graphic shows the tournament tree for the rest of the competition. For the first time ever, the knockout rounds are decided by the league phase - with no separate draws for the last-16, quarter-finals and beyond.

For example, the teams who finish first or second in the league phase will face a team who finishes in 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th.

Compare that to the team who finishes in seventh or eighth, who could play a team who finishes in 23rd or 24th but also run the risk of facing the team in ninth or 10th spot - which could be a major European outfit.

The advantage for the team finishing first or second is they will guarantee playing a team in the 'middle' of the final Champions League table. Finishing lower down runs the risk of playing a better side.

When are the 2024/25 Champions League knockout stages?

Knockout round play-offs: February 11/12 and February 18/19, 2025

Round of 16: March 4/5 and March 11/12, 2025

Quarter-finals: April 8/9 and April 15/16, 2025

Semi-finals: April 29/30 and May 6/7, 2025

Final: May 31, 2025

74ca6fa7-79e8-444e-9e1b-127e13d4ed69,Champions League final price freeze for fans of competing teams but big increases for high-end seats,"NYON, Switzerland (AP) — Ticket prices at the men’s Champions League final are unchanged from last year for most fans of the two competing teams with big increases only for high-end seats, UEFA said Monday.

Each finalist will get 18,000 tickets for the May 31 game at Bayern Munich’s stadium with a special lowest-price rate of 70 euros ($77). That’s the same price as the lowest cost tickets at the 2024 final played at Wembley Stadium in London.

Substantial price hikes have been added to the two highest-rated categories of seats. Top-price tickets go from 713 euros ($781) last year to 950 euros ($1,040) this time, and “category 2” tickets rise from 500 euros ($548) last year to 650 euros ($712), UEFA said.

Ticket revenue from UEFA club finals goes into the overall pot of billions of euros (dollars) in revenue from broadcasting and commercial deals that is mostly paid back to hundreds of clubs each season as prize money and solidarity payments. Real Madrid, the Champions League winner last year, got the highest payment of $154 million from UEFA.

UEFA said 38,700 tickets of the 64,500 available for the showpiece game in Munich are sold “directly for fans and the general public to purchase.”

In addition to quotas for the two finalists, a further 2,700 tickets can be bought by fans worldwide on UEFA’s website. Buyers are limited to two tickets.

More than 25,000 tickets are reserved for sponsors, broadcasters, national soccer federations and UEFA guests.

Dinamo drew Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Arsenal, AC Milan, Celtic, Salzburg, Monaco and S. Bratislava.

Under the new format, each of the 36 clubs plays eight matches in four home games and four away games.

The top eight teams in the league will move directly to the knockout stages, while teams finishing between ninth and 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off for a spot in the last 16.

Here is Dinamo’s schedule:



• 17 September 2024, 21:00 – FC Bayern Munich (A)

• 2 October 2024, 21:00 – AS Monaco (H)

• 23 October 2024, 21:00 – FC Salzburg (A)

• 21 January 2025, 21:00 – Arsenal FC (A)

• 29 January 2025, 21:00 – AC Milan (H)

Clubs ranked twenty-fifth to thirty-sixth are eliminated from Europe, meaning they do not continue in the Europa League.

The first round of the Champions League will be played from Tuesday to Thursday, with the remaining seven rounds, as usual, taking place on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

The knockout phase begins on 11 February, and the final will be held on 31 May at the Allianz Arena.

“I am satisfied with the draw because this is the Champions League. We will battle with everyone to see where we stand at that level, and there are teams against whom I believe we can compete and it will be 50-50. Let’s see how many points we can take,” the Dinamo manager said after the draw.",croatiaweek.com,2024-08-31T11:33:22.000000Z,https://www.croatiaweek.com/dinamo-zagrebs-champions-league-match-schedule-released/
e63c21e2-a191-4604-92e4-5def125824cd,"UEFA Seeks ""Competitive Balance"" With New Champions League 2024-25 Format","A new era in European club football begins on Thursday when the draw takes place in Monaco for an expanded UEFA Champions League featuring a radically changed format. European football's governing body is selling what it describes as ""a thrilling new future"" for the game on the continent with more teams playing more matches, and more prize money on offer. UEFA needs to generate hype around the new format, because there is a risk -- in the beginning at least -- that fans will find it confusing compared to the old model.

For the last 21 years, the Champions League had consisted of a group stage in which 32 clubs were split into eight groups of four, each playing six games. The top two in each group qualified for the knockout phase.

The new version will feature 36 clubs with everyone playing eight matches, but all teams pooled together into one giant league rather than in groups.

Clubs will still be split into four seeded pots of nine teams, with every participant given two opponents from each pot.

The top eight in the final ranking go through to the last 16, while the next 16 sides advance to an intermediate play-off round and the remainder go out.

The new format was introduced against the backdrop of the threat by Europe's biggest clubs to break away and form their own Super League.

But UEFA are also hoping the format can be a solution to the problem of competitive imbalance in the sport which was making the group stage more predictable.

""The new format will introduce a better competitive balance between all the teams, with the possibility for each team to play opponents of a similar competitive level throughout the league phase,"" UEFA say.

Financial rewards

What the changes will certainly not address are concerns about too much football being played and damaging the quality as a result.

The increasing demands on players, and the lack of rest as a result, were cited as reasons why many matches at Euro 2024 proved disappointing.

The new Champions League, in a season which is also set to finish with the first expanded version of FIFA's Club World Cup, will feature a total of 144 games in the group stage, up from 96 before.

The financial rewards are greater, however, with UEFA's total prize pot for the Champions League rising by about 25 percent to almost 2.5 billion euros ($2.79 billion).

The winners of the competition can pocket over 86 million euros just in prize money, not including bonuses of 700,000 euros for every point gained in the league phase or income from television.

Real Madrid were the winners last season, raising the trophy for the sixth time in the last 11 years.

The addition of Kylian Mbappe to their squad means they will hope to go all the way again, and emerge victorious in the final in Munich on May 31, next year.

Newcomers

This season's Champions League will include newcomers such as Girona from Spain, while Bologna of Italy take part in Europe's elite club competition for the first time in 60 years.

Brest of France had never qualified for any European competition before, but now take part after finishing third in Ligue 1 last season -- taking advantage of the extra place handed to France as the fifth-ranked league in Europe.

As for the other additional places, one goes to a national champion who will emerge from the qualifying rounds, while Italy and Germany get an extra team each because of the performances of their clubs in Europe last season.

UEFA said the draw itself will be a ""hybrid"" affair, between the manual drawing of balls and the use of software, having calculated that doing it all by hand would take more than three hours.

The Europa League and Conference League, the draws for which will both take place on Friday, will also now feature 36 teams, although there will be only six matches for clubs in the league phase of the latter competition.

From the 2024/2025 season, the UEFA Champions League will be contested under a radically different format.

The change of format comes as the tournament expands from a 32-team showpiece, swelling to 36 teams from next term.

Champions League changes

“UEFA has clearly shown that we are fully committed to respecting the fundamental values of sport and to defending the key principle of open competitions, with qualification based on sporting merit, fully in line with the values and solidarity-based European sports model,” said UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin. “I am really pleased that it was a unanimous decision of the UEFA Executive Committee, with the European Club Association, European Leagues and national associations all agreeing with the proposal made.

“Another proof that European football is more united than ever.”

How will the UEFA Champions League format change?

Under the new Champions League format, teams will play eight matches in the new league phase, which replaces the former group stage.

Teams in the Champions League will no longer play three opponents twice – home and away.

Instead qualified teams face fixtures against eight different sides, playing half of those matches at home and half away across the eight matchdays.

Will there still be a UEFA Champions League draw

There will still be a Champions League draw for the league phase.

Four seeding pots of nine teams will be settled by rankings. These rankings will be based on the current co-efficient system.

Each team will then be drawn to play two opponents from each of these pots. They will play one match against a team from each pot, home and away.

UEFA said: “This gives the opportunity for clubs to test themselves against a wider range of opponents and raises the prospect for fans of seeing the top teams go head to head more often and earlier in the competition. It will also result in more competitive matches for every club across the board.”

In effect this brings about the radical departure. The UEFA Champions League will take on a different look from next season.

How will teams reach the knockout phase?

The outcomes of each match will determine the overall standing in the new league, with three points for a victory and one for a draw remaining the points system in use.

The top eight clubs in the league will advance to the round of 16, while the teams ranking ninth to twenty-fourth will participate in an additional two-legged knockout phase play-off to clinch their spot in the competition’s final 16.

Elimination faces teams who finish 25th or lower. They will not be eligible to compete in the UEFA Europa League.

UEFA claim: “The new format, with all the teams ranked together in a single league, will mean that there is more to play for all the way through to the final night of the league phase.”

After Liverpool's 2-1 victory over Lille, Reds head coach Slot, whose side top the table, said ""we still don't know yet"" if it is an advantage for clubs to end as first or second seed (where his side will end) or simply finish in the top eight.

The higher a team finishes in the league table, the higher they are 'seeded', and that should - based on league performance - determine an easier path to the final.

But with a number of European heavyweights low in the standings, the new format means they could still be formidable opponents for a side that finishes higher up the table.

Why does finishing higher in the Champions League league table matter?

Overall, there are two paths to the knockout phase from the league phase:

Finish in the top eight and go straight through to the round of 16 Finish from ninth to 24th and go through to a two-legged knockout play-off

Teams who finish from 25th-36th are eliminated and unlike previous seasons, no team will drop into the Europa League.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liverpool head coach Arne Slot says the new league format in the Champions League 'doesn't tell you everything'

But within those paths, the higher a team finishes within each of the groups that qualify, the better their route to the later stages of the tournament will be.

For example:

If a team finishes first or second, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the 17th/18th and 15th/16th seeds in the round of 16.

If a team finishes seventh or eighth, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the ninth/10th and 23rd/24th seeds in the round of 16.

Image: The Champions League knockout bracket in full

If a team finishes 15th or 16th, they will play either the 17th or 18th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the first or second seed in the round of 16.

If a team finishes 21st or 22nd, they will play either the 11th or 12th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the fifth or sixth seed in the round of 16.

Essentially the higher a team places, the better chance they have of avoiding another higher seed early in the knockout phase.

Wait, so Liverpool finishing first or second doesn't make a difference?

Not significantly. With teams grouped in this way, both first and second will be seeded and then drawn against teams that have finished 15th-18th and progress from their play-off. Both first and second will get to play the second leg of that last-16 tie at home.

But if Liverpool finish first or second, why don't they play the worst team (23rd or 24th)?

In theory, Liverpool (and likely Barcelona) will play the worst teams in the competition when they re-enter it. The seeding system is designed so a higher seed will get an easier run to the final.

If the knockout play-off games go as planned, the higher-seeded teams will win their games - therefore, the teams ranked ninth to 16th will make it through to the last 16, and the teams ranked 17th to 24th will be knocked out. In that case, Liverpool would indeed play one of the two worst teams remaining.

Additionally, the pathway is as much about avoiding the higher seeds as it is about playing against the lower ones. By finishing in the top two, Liverpool will avoid any team seeded higher than 15th in the round of 16, any team higher than seventh in the quarter-final, and cannot play the other top-seeded team until the final.

Is there a draw for the Champions League knockout round? When is it?

There will be two draws after the league phase.

The first draw on Friday January 31 at 11am will determine which of the two options each team will get in the knockout play-off. For example, a team finishing 13th will find out whether they are playing against the team finishing 19th or 20th.

Seeded teams (ninth-16th) will have the second leg at home and those play-off round matches take place on February 11/12 and February 18/19.

Teams seeded from first to eighth will have to wait until Friday February 21 to find out their opponents.

That draw will then determine who they face in the round of 16, and ultimately map out their full path to the final.

Can teams from the same country face each other in the knockout playoffs?

Yes. Unlike previous years in which they were kept apart in the first draw, teams can face others from the same country - and other teams who they already played in the league phase - in the knockout play-offs and beyond.

I'm a fan of a British club - who will we play next and what do we need in the final week?

There may be some confusion over what this means for your team, so as it stands, let's take a look at what the path for the British teams looks like right now and what they each need to finish as high as possible in the final standings...

Liverpool (Current seed: 1st)

Knockout play-offs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Bayern Munich (15th), Real Madrid (16th), Juventus (17th) or Celtic (18th)

What Liverpool need in the final week: Technically nothing as they are secured a top-two seed. However, a point against PSV (or bettering Barcelona's result) will mean they top the league-phase table.

Arsenal (Current seed: 3rd)

Knockout play-offs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Brest (13th), Dortmund (14th), PSV (19th) or Club Brugge (20th)

What Arsenal need in the final week: They are all but certain to finish in the top eight, as the teams below them would need to significantly better their result to move above them. A point against Girona secures a top-eight place and a win keeps them as a third or fourth seed.

Aston Villa (Current seed: 9th)

Knockout play-offs: vs Sporting (23rd) or Stuttgart (24th)

Round of 16: vs Atalanta (7th) or Leverkusen (8th)

What Aston Villa need in the final week: They have secured a spot in the knockout play-offs. To move into the top eight, they need a win against Celtic combined with a loss by either Atletico Madrid, Milan, Atalanta or Bayer Leverkusen - but also need to maintain their better goal difference than the four teams directly below them. They can technically get in with a draw but would need a miracle with several other results to go their way!

Celtic (Current seed: 18th)

Knockout playoffs: vs Bayern Munich (15th) or Real Madrid (16th)

Round of 16: vs Liverpool (1st) or Barcelona (2nd)

What Celtic need in the final week: They have secured a spot in the knockout play-offs and are still fighting for a higher seeding. They can technically reach the top eight but would need to beat Aston Villa and have a large number of other results go their way.

Manchester City (Current seed: 25th)

As it stands, Manchester City would be eliminated from European football.

What Manchester City need in the final week: They will secure a knockout play-off spot by beating Club Brugge - who need a point to secure a place of their own. A draw will not be enough for Man City to go through.

Image: Pep Guardiola and Man City are 25th in the table and heading out of the competition as it stands

How much could the table change in the last week?

A lot! On Tuesday night last week, Julian Alvarez's 90th-minute winner moved Atletico Madrid from 11th to third in the table in a matter of seconds.

With just one game to go, just three points separate the teams in eighth (Leverkusen, 13 points) and 24th (Stuttgart, 10 points)!

Plenty of movement will happen, and to add to the drama, every single match on the final matchday is being played at the same time - 8pm kick-off on Wednesday January 29.

Will there be any 'dead rubbers' in the final week?

Only two!

Ahead of the final matchday, nine teams have been mathematically eliminated - Bologna, Sparta Prague, RB Leipzig, Girona, Red Star Belgrade, Sturm Graz, RB Salzburg, Slovan Bratislava and Young Boys.

Red Star Belgrade face Young Boys on the final day, while Sturm Graz play RB Leipzig in matches that will not affect the final seedings, but every other team is involved in a meaningful game.

After Liverpool's 2-1 victory over Lille, Reds head coach Slot, whose side top the table, said ""we still don't know yet"" if it is an advantage for clubs to end as first or second seed (where his side will end) or simply finish in the top eight.

The higher a team finishes in the league table, the higher they are 'seeded', and that should - based on league performance - determine an easier path to the final.

But with a number of European heavyweights low in the standings, the new format means they could still be formidable opponents for a side that finishes higher up the table.

Champions League - what we know so far Confirmed in round of 16



Liverpool, Barcelona



Confirmed in round of 16 or knockout phase play-offs



Arsenal, Aston Villa, Atalanta, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Brest, Celtic, Dortmund, Feyenoord, Inter Milan, Juventus, Leverkusen, Lille, AC Milan, Monaco, Real Madrid



Confirmed in knockout phase play-offs



None



Eliminated



Bologna, Red Star Belgrade, Girona, Leipzig, Slovan Bratislava, Sparta Prague, Sturm Graz, Young Boys.

Why does finishing higher in the Champions League league table matter?

Overall, there are two paths to the knockout phase from the league phase:

Finish in the top eight and go straight through to the round of 16 Finish from ninth to 24th and go through to a two-legged knockout play-off

Teams who finish from 25th-36th are eliminated and unlike previous seasons, no team will drop into the Europa League.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liverpool head coach Arne Slot says the new league format in the Champions League 'doesn't tell you everything'

But within those paths, the higher a team finishes within each of the groups that qualify, the better their route to the later stages of the tournament will be.

For example:

If a team finishes first or second, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the 17th/18th and 15th/16th seeds in the round of 16.

If a team finishes seventh or eighth, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the ninth/10th and 23rd/24th seeds in the round of 16.

Image: The Champions League knockout bracket in full

If a team finishes 15th or 16th, they will play either the 17th or 18th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the first or second seed in the round of 16.

If a team finishes 21st or 22nd, they will play either the 11th or 12th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the fifth or sixth seed in the round of 16.

Essentially the higher a team places, the better chance they have of avoiding another higher seed early in the knockout phase.

Wait, so Liverpool finishing first or second doesn't make a difference?

Not significantly. With teams grouped in this way, both first and second will be seeded and then drawn against teams that have finished 15th-18th and progress from their play-off. Both first and second will get to play the second leg of that last-16 tie at home.

But if Liverpool finish first or second, why don't they play the worst team (23rd or 24th)?

In theory, Liverpool (and likely Barcelona) will play the worst teams in the competition when they re-enter it. The seeding system is designed so a higher seed will get an easier run to the final.

If the knockout play-off games go as planned, the higher-seeded teams will win their games - therefore, the teams ranked ninth to 16th will make it through to the last 16, and the teams ranked 17th to 24th will be knocked out. In that case, Liverpool would indeed play one of the two worst teams remaining.

Additionally, the pathway is as much about avoiding the higher seeds as it is about playing against the lower ones. By finishing in the top two, Liverpool will avoid any team seeded higher than 15th in the round of 16, any team higher than seventh in the quarter-final, and cannot play the other top-seeded team until the final.

That draw will then determine who they face in the round of 16, and ultimately map out their full path to the final.

Can teams from the same country face each other in the knockout playoffs?

Yes. Unlike previous years in which they were kept apart in the first draw, teams can face others from the same country - and other teams who they already played in the league phase - in the knockout play-offs and beyond.

Teams seeded from first to eighth will have to wait until Friday February 21 to find out their opponents.

That draw will then determine who they face in the round of 16, and ultimately map out their full path to the final.

Can teams from the same country face each other in the knockout playoffs?

Yes. Unlike previous years in which they were kept apart in the first draw, teams can face others from the same country - and other teams who they already played in the league phase - in the knockout play-offs and beyond.

I'm a fan of a British club - who will we play next and what do we need in the final week?

There may be some confusion over what this means for your team, so as it stands, let's take a look at what the path for the British teams looks like right now and what they each need to finish as high as possible in the final standings...

Liverpool (Current seed: 1st)

Knockout play-offs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Bayern Munich (15th), Real Madrid (16th), Juventus (17th) or Celtic (18th)

What Liverpool need in the final week: Technically nothing as they are secured a top-two seed. However, a point against PSV (or bettering Barcelona's result) will mean they top the league-phase table.

Arsenal (Current seed: 3rd)

Knockout play-offs: N/A

Round of 16: vs Brest (13th), Dortmund (14th), PSV (19th) or Club Brugge (20th)

What Arsenal need in the final week: They are all but certain to finish in the top eight, as the teams below them would need to significantly better their result to move above them. A point against Girona secures a top-eight place and a win keeps them as a third or fourth seed.

Aston Villa (Current seed: 9th)

Knockout play-offs: vs Sporting (23rd) or Stuttgart (24th)

Round of 16: vs Atalanta (7th) or Leverkusen (8th)

What Aston Villa need in the final week: They have secured a spot in the knockout play-offs. To move into the top eight, they need a win against Celtic combined with a loss by either Atletico Madrid, Milan, Atalanta or Bayer Leverkusen - but also need to maintain their better goal difference than the four teams directly below them. They can technically get in with a draw but would need a miracle with several other results to go their way!

Celtic (Current seed: 18th)

Knockout playoffs: vs Bayern Munich (15th) or Real Madrid (16th)

Round of 16: vs Liverpool (1st) or Barcelona (2nd)

What Celtic need in the final week: They have secured a spot in the knockout play-offs and are still fighting for a higher seeding. They can technically reach the top eight but would need to beat Aston Villa and have a large number of other results go their way.

Manchester City (Current seed: 25th)

As it stands, Manchester City would be eliminated from European football.

What Manchester City need in the final week: They will secure a knockout play-off spot by beating Club Brugge - who need a point to secure a place of their own. A draw will not be enough for Man City to go through.

Image: Pep Guardiola and Man City are 25th in the table and heading out of the competition as it stands

How much could the table change in the last week?

A lot! On Tuesday night last week, Julian Alvarez's 90th-minute winner moved Atletico Madrid from 11th to third in the table in a matter of seconds.

With just one game to go, just three points separate the teams in eighth (Leverkusen, 13 points) and 24th (Stuttgart, 10 points)!

Plenty of movement will happen, and to add to the drama, every single match on the final matchday is being played at the same time - 8pm kick-off on Wednesday January 29.

Will there be any 'dead rubbers' in the final week?

Only two!

Ahead of the final matchday, nine teams have been mathematically eliminated - Bologna, Sparta Prague, RB Leipzig, Girona, Red Star Belgrade, Sturm Graz, RB Salzburg, Slovan Bratislava and Young Boys.

Red Star Belgrade face Young Boys on the final day, while Sturm Graz play RB Leipzig in matches that will not affect the final seedings, but every other team is involved in a meaningful game.

d3753783-c420-49be-bd9b-dd33aca38c1a,"Champions League 2024/25: Knockout round, last 16 draw explained, league table seedings and who plays who next","Just one round of matches remains in the league phase of the Champions League, and even Arne Slot is wondering what the final 'seedings' and knockout phase will mean for each team next.

After Liverpool's 2-1 victory over Lille, Reds head coach Slot, whose side top the table, said ""we still don't know yet"" if it is an advantage for clubs to end as first or second seed (where his side will end) or simply finish in the top eight.

The higher a team finishes in the league table, the higher they are 'seeded', and that should - based on league performance - determine an easier path to the final.

But with a number of European heavyweights low in the standings, the new format means they could still be formidable opponents for a side that finishes higher up the table.

We are here to answer all the questions you may have about the league table, seedings, and how the knockout phase works...

Champions League - what we know so far Confirmed in round of 16



Liverpool, Barcelona



Confirmed in round of 16 or knockout phase play-offs



Arsenal, Aston Villa, Atalanta, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Brest, Celtic, Dortmund, Feyenoord, Inter Milan, Juventus, Leverkusen, Lille, AC Milan, Monaco, Real Madrid



Confirmed in knockout phase play-offs



None



Eliminated



Bologna, Red Star Belgrade, Girona, Leipzig, Slovan Bratislava, Sparta Prague, Sturm Graz, Young Boys.

Why does finishing higher in the Champions League league table matter?

Overall, there are two paths to the knockout phase from the league phase:

Finish in the top eight and go straight through to the round of 16 Finish from ninth to 24th and go through to a two-legged knockout play-off

Teams who finish from 25th-36th are eliminated and unlike previous seasons, no team will drop into the Europa League.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liverpool head coach Arne Slot says the new league format in the Champions League 'doesn't tell you everything'

But within those paths, the higher a team finishes within each of the groups that qualify, the better their route to the later stages of the tournament will be.

For example:

If a team finishes first or second, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the 17th/18th and 15th/16th seeds in the round of 16.

If a team finishes seventh or eighth, they will skip the knockout play-offs and play one of the winners of the matches between the ninth/10th and 23rd/24th seeds in the round of 16.

Image: The Champions League knockout bracket in full

If a team finishes 15th or 16th, they will play either the 17th or 18th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the first or second seed in the round of 16.

If a team finishes 21st or 22nd, they will play either the 11th or 12th seed in the knockout play-offs, followed by the fifth or sixth seed in the round of 16.

Essentially the higher a team places, the better chance they have of avoiding another higher seed early in the knockout phase.

Wait, so Liverpool finishing first or second doesn't make a difference?

Not significantly. With teams grouped in this way, both first and second will be seeded and then drawn against teams that have finished 15th-18th and progress from their play-off. Both first and second will get to play the second leg of that last-16 tie at home.

But if Liverpool finish first or second, why don't they play the worst team (23rd or 24th)?

In theory, Liverpool (and likely Barcelona) will play the worst teams in the competition when they re-enter it. The seeding system is designed so a higher seed will get an easier run to the final.

If the knockout play-off games go as planned, the higher-seeded teams will win their games - therefore, the teams ranked ninth to 16th will make it through to the last 16, and the teams ranked 17th to 24th will be knocked out. In that case, Liverpool would indeed play one of the two worst teams remaining.

Additionally, the pathway is as much about avoiding the higher seeds as it is about playing against the lower ones. By finishing in the top two, Liverpool will avoid any team seeded higher than 15th in the round of 16, any team higher than seventh in the quarter-final, and cannot play the other top-seeded team until the final.

Is there a draw for the Champions League knockout round? When is it?

There will be two draws after the league phase.

The first draw on Friday January 31 at 11am will determine which of the two options each team will get in the knockout play-off. For example, a team finishing 13th will find out whether they are playing against the team finishing 19th or 20th.

Seeded teams (ninth-16th) will have the second leg at home and those play-off round matches take place on February 11/12 and February 18/19.

Teams seeded from first to eighth will have to wait until Friday February 21 to find out their opponents.

That draw will then determine who they face in the round of 16, and ultimately map out their full path to the final.

Can teams from the same country face each other in the knockout playoffs?

Yes. Unlike previous years in which they were kept apart in the first draw, teams can face others from the same country - and other teams who they already played in the league phase - in the knockout play-offs and beyond.

Why the final league phase match should matter to most teams in the UCL (2:44)

Open Extended Reactions

The pots for Thursday's UEFA Champions League draw have been finalised after the playoff round was completed on Wednesday.

It will be the first time a draw takes place under the new format, which sees all 36 teams in one league table.

The draw will begin at 5 p.m. UK / midday ET, with the first fixtures scheduled for Sept. 17-19. The league phase will stretch into January, with all 18 games on the final matchday being played at the same time.

Rather than placing teams into groups, the draw will create eight fixtures for each club. There will be two matches, one at home and one away, against teams from each of the four pots.

As teams now play games against clubs from their own pot there is no benefit from being in Pot 1. In previous seasons, being in Pot 1 meant you would avoid playing matches against the strongest clubs in the tournament.

Pot 1 used to house the holders of the Champions League and Europa League, plus the champions of the top six domestic leagues. Pots 2 through 4 would then be ordered by strength based on UEFA's club coefficient, which ranks clubs on performance in Europe over the previous five seasons. Now only the Champions League titleholders will be automatically in Pot 1, all other positions will be on the UEFA club coefficient.

While clubs will learn their opponents and venues on Thursday, the order of the fixtures will not be published by UEFA until Saturday.

This season the final will be held at the Allianz Arena in Munich on Saturday, May 31.

Champions League has finished its sixth matchweek of the League Phase, with the final games of 2024, including some high profile matches such as Borussia Dortmund - Barcelona, Juventus - Manchester City or Arsenal - Monaco.

Barcelona beat BVB 3-2 in an intense match that secures Barcelona's place in the top eight, currently second just behind Liverpool and the only team with 15 points. Borussia is left outside of the top 8 (9th) and tied with Bayern Munich (10th) with the same points (12) and goal average (9).

The rest of the top 8, that gets direct qualification to the round of 16, has 13 points. That includes Arsenal (3rd), which beat Monaco (16th) 3-0, making the Monegasque team, one of the early sensations of the tournament, fall to the middle of the table after two consecutive defeats.

It also includes another surprise of the season: Lille Olympique Sporting Club (8th), which beat Sturm 3-2, almost securing their elimination (the Austrian Bundesliga leader is 29th in the charts).

Bad news for PSG (25th) despite winning yesterday, as Feyenoord (18th) beat Sparta Praha 4-2 and jumped positions, once again kicking the Parisian club out of the top 24.

Stuttgart (26th) thrashing Young Boys 5-1 also threatens PSG, as that puts them with the same amount of points, 7, and with a direct clash in January between the German and French clubs that could be decisive.

And then there's Manchester City. Third Champions League match without a victory leaves them 22nd, with the same points as Dinamo Zagreb or PSV (which, thankfully for Guardiola, tied and lost this week). PSG welcomes Manchester City on January 22: if one of them loosses, qualification for the knockout phase will be very tight...

Mikel Arteta's Arsenal are all set to welcome Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg of the UFA Champions League quarterfinal match. Bukayo Saka, who recently returned from injury, could be given a start in the playing XI with the Gunners' boss showing confidence on the England forward.

With the Premier League title all but out of gasp, the Gunners now target the Champions League title by knocking out the defending champions. Mikel Arteta’s men are no pushovers either, after the group stage in third place.

Arsenal’s progression to this stage had been their strong back line, which has conceded just three times throughout the league stage. A relatively easy draw in the Round of 16 round saw them thrash PSV 9-3 across two legs, but they are now against the 13-time UCL winner Real Madrid.

The Los Blancos will enter the fixture with a 1-2 loss against Valencia in La Liga, which has further widened the gap between them and Barcelona. Their journey in the continental tournament hasn’t been smooth either, as they needed penalties and a controversial decision to scrap Julian Alvarez’s spot kick to overcome Atletico Madrid in the last round.

However, Carlo Ancelotti’s men have never exited the Champions League at the quarter-final stage since 2003-04, winning their last 12 bouts at this stage. However, Arsenal will be confident going into Tuesday’s must-win clash.

Guardiola's side sit fourth having recovered from an awful end to 2024, but they still have work to do in the fight for a Champions League spot, with five teams separated by just two points.

One of those teams are Tuesday's opponents Aston Villa, who they face live on Sky Sports.

Asked if the game against Villa was like a cup final, Guardiola said: ""Absolutely. And after Aston Villa the game against Wolves will be a final, then Southampton because every game counts.

""But Villa are a contender to qualify for the Champions League and when you see the game they played against my friend Luis Enrique and PSG I was really impressed.

""They can play a low block but when they decide to go, with the weapons they have, the speed they have, the set-pieces, it's a final and we need our people because I think our people want the Champions League again next season and hopefully they can wait from minute one.

""Sometimes we are slow, sometimes we are not playing good, but we need them desperately to support us, to make noise and being there all the time because it's a final. Absolutely it is a final for us.""

Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies coach Jerry Tshabalala believes his team has what it takes to go all the way in the CAF Women’s Champions League.

Banyana Ba Style, who are the defending champions of the competition having won it last year, lost 1-0 to FC Masar of Egypt in their first match, but they bounced back in style on Wednesday, hammering CBE 4-0 to keep their hopes of reaching the semifinals alive.

A brace from Melinda Kgadiete and a goal each for Boitumelo Rabale and Lelona Daweti earned Sundowns a comfortable win over the Ethiopian side.

Despite his team scoring four goals in the match, Tshabalala was not happy with his team’s finishing saying they could have scored more.

”It was important for us to bounce back strongly. We started the tournament on a negative note, so we needed to redeem ourselves today and credit the girls for the performance. As much as we scored about four goals, there are still a few things that I believe I am not happy with, I think we should have scored more than four goals in this match. I still believe there’s room for improvement in the team,” said Tshabalala.

”First game was very difficult, I think we should have wrapped it up in the first half and we didn’t do that. But we are a strong team and believe we will go to the semi-final, and for us to be champions we want to beat everyone, it doesn’t matter which team, we have got to beat all the teams that are here in the tournament,” added Tshabalala.

Sundowns are currently third in Group B with three points, one point behind joint leaders Edo Queens and FC Masar, who played to a goalless draw in the other Group B match on Wednesday. CBE are last with no points.

They next face Edo Queens while FC Masar will play bottom-placed and winless CBE in the final group matches.

b39a675b-2cbc-47fb-a9ec-697561775f1e,Champions League: Barca prodigy Yamal puts Messi and Ronaldo to shame,"Lamine Yamal is already a household name at 17. Last night’s performance in the Champions League has drawn insane comparisons to Messi and Ronaldo.

Yamal stars on a crazy night in the UEFA Champions League

When Marcus Thuram nonchalantly backheeled Inter Milan into the lead after 30 seconds of their Champions League semi-final first leg away to Barcelona, the watching world knew they were about to witness something special. The tie ended 3-3, with Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal stealing the show with yet another virtuoso display on the grandest stage in club football. The 17-year-old was already making his 100th appearance for FC Barcelona; he’s now scored 22 times and made 33 assists for the Catalan giants. Already looking like a complete attacker, the inverted right-winger has six goals and 14 assists in 30 LaLiga appearances in 2024-2025. This season’s Champions League has also been his playground. The astonishingly gifted left footer has five goals and four assists from 12 outings in the elite competition. He is now the youngster player ever to score in a Champions League semi-final.

Already a winner with Spain, can he eclipse Messi and Ronaldo?

To put this absurdly talented youngster’s numbers into perspective, let’s stack them up against two of the greats. What were Messi and Ronaldo doing when they were 17? Cristiano Ronaldo had only made 19 appearances with five goals and four assists. Lionel Messi only had NINE senior appearances under his belt with a solitary goal and no assists. Both of those men enjoyed freakish longevity. Ronaldo was an especially late bloomer, but the early signs already indicate that Yamal can become the best footballer of his generation. His stunning solo effort against Inter, as well as his screamer in the Euro 2024 semi-final for Spain against France, are proof that the BMT is there. Yamal and La Roja went all the way. If Barca go to the Champions League final, their opponents will need a master plan to somehow contain the best teenage talent on the planet.

City, who are looking to qualify for Europe’s top club competition for a 15th straight season, have won just one of their last eight Premier League games and are seventh in the table, 12 points behind leaders Liverpool.

Only Arsenal between 1998 and 2017, and Manchester United between 1996 and 2014, have a longer record of qualifying among English clubs.

""Ho, ho, ho Cityzens!"" 🎅 A festive message from our players 👇 — Manchester City (@ManCity) December 25, 2024

Guardiola’s side are four points behind Nottingham Forest, who occupy the fourth and final Champions League qualification berth at Christmas.

“When I said before, people laughed. They said, ‘qualifying for the Champions League is not a big success’. But I know it because it happens with clubs in this country,” Guardiola told reporters ahead of their home match against Everton on Boxing Day.

“They were dominant for many years and after they were many years not qualifying for the Champions League.

“The one team that has been in the Champions League for the past years has been Manchester City. Now we are at risk, of course we are.

“If we don’t qualify it is because we don’t deserve it, because we were not prepared and because we had a lot of problems and didn’t solve them.”

The final round of league stage games of the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League will be played simultaneously on Wednesday, with all 36 teams in action across 18 matches.

Aston Villa, ninth with 13 points, will make a late push to make the top eight, but most in need of a win among the Premier League teams are Manchester City, who are 25th, with eight points, one place and 2 points outside the qualification zone.

In three of the four seasons before this one, Chelsea's Champions League dream died at the hands of the Catalan club. There was the final humbling in 2021, and two semi-final heartbreaks in 2023 and 2024.

But is 2025 the year they finally break the hoodoo? Is now the time we realise why Sonia Bompastor was brought to Chelsea?

When do Chelsea play Barcelona? Sunday April 20 - Women's Champions League semi-final first leg, Estadi Johan Cruyff, kick-off 5pm

Sunday April 27 - Women's Champions League semi-final second leg, Stamford Bridge, kick-off 2pm

The French coach has the experience of downing Barcelona on the biggest stage. Her Lyon side overcame the Catalan challenge in the Champions League final of 2022, albeit losing another final to the same opposition last season.

So how do you beat Barcelona? ""I'm not going to reveal all the secrets because I think it's important to keep some for myself and for my players!"" Bompastor tells Sky Sports.

There are signs that this Chelsea under this manager hold the key to not just beating Barcelona, but breaking a bigger blockade in terms of the Champions League. Barcelona and Lyon, Bompastor's former club, have won every edition of the tournament since 2016.

Should Bompastor beat Barcelona with Chelsea, it will then be Lyon or Arsenal in the final. It feels the French coach has the keys to unlocking this dual dominance.

The reason why Chelsea and Bompastor hold the power is not just because they are the WSL's dominant side - but the manner in which they go about their business.

Take the Champions League quarter-final win over Manchester City. Yes, the Blues were 2-0 down from the first leg, but even against an attack involving Vivianne Miedema, Kerolin and Jess Park, there was an aura that Chelsea were always going to come back. They did, via a superb 3-0 second-leg win, with City demolished by half-time.

Very few teams have the aura to compete with Chelsea. Yet Barcelona are one of them - their air of superiority has been too much for the Blues in recent years.

Bompastor is a firm believer in 70 to 80 per cent of the on-pitch challenges being in the brain so tacking this aura is step one of her plan to write Chelsea into history.

""It's just like we talked about in the last round. The belief you need to have going into these big challenges is really important,"" says the Chelsea head coach.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Chelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor says her team aims to have a killer mentality in every match

""It's about the determination you need to show, the trust you need to show to your players for them to feel confident going into these big challenges. I think mental skills are really important in these big-game performances.

""Every element in the performance - technical aspects, tactical aspects, physical aspects and mental aspects - are important. But sometimes the mental aspects are the most important.

""I think from the game against Manchester City, you could see our determination. The ones against Barcelona, we'll have to be brave.""

The formbook tends to go out the window when it comes to these games - but context is important for a side going for a quadruple this season.

Chelsea come into the Barcelona clash in unconvincing form, by their high standards. Before the international break, there was a blip in drawing at home to West Ham, missing the chance to set a new club record for the most consecutive home wins.

Then last weekend, they needed a stoppage-time Aggie Beever-Jones winner to overcome managerless Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-finals.

It's not exactly a Chelsea on top form, but Bompastor believes the level of Women's Super League teams is a help, not a hindrance, to their continental chances.

""I think having this competitive league helps a lot,"" says Bompastor. ""Because for any team who is able to compete in the league, it will bring some confidence going into these big games in the Champions League.""

But there are negative sides to it as well - especially when compared to Barcelona and Lyon's respective contexts.

Take last season's Champions League semi-finals as an example. Barcelona came into the last-four ties with Chelsea with the league all but wrapped up. The Champions League could be prioritised - whereas Hayes' Chelsea were chasing down then-league leaders Man City at the same time.

Image: Chelsea were dumped out at the Champions League semi-final stage by Barcelona last season

It was the same with Bompastor's Lyon last season, who had already secured top spot a full month before their Champions League semi-finals with PSG came around. It is the same this year as they prepare to take on Arsenal.

""I think it's a challenge to be able to perform in every competition when you are an English side because every single weekend is a difficult game to play,"" says Bompastor.

""In terms of schedule, the English league just needs to help the clubs to be in the best place possible to perform against the best clubs.

""Maybe we can all work together and try to think what is the best schedule for the English teams coming into March, April and May - to make sure the squads are in a better place to perform against the best teams in Europe. That's the main thing to make sure for me.

""When you talk about Lyon and Barcelona, as you could see in their league, they are really dominant. I think coming into this moment in the season, they have some freshness because their games in the league are less competitive than our games.""

But this year, the context seems different - at least on Chelsea's side of the draw.

Unlike last year, Barcelona do not have the league wrapped up. They host Sevilla just days before the semi-final first leg, with the Catalan club trying to fend off Real Madrid, who are sat four points behind them.

So Barcelona have a sideways distraction alongside Chelsea, who boast one of the best squads in Europe.

""Being able to compete in every competition - with these tough games every week, every three days - you need to have depth in your squad,"" says Bompastor. ""Because if not, it's really more difficult.

Liverpool fans' claims against UEFA over Paris 2022 Champions League final chaos can be heard in English court, judge rules

Liverpool supporters showing their tickets as they struggle to get into the Champions League final in Paris

The legal claims of more than 800 Liverpool fans against European football's governing body UEFA over the chaos of the Paris 2022 Champions League final can be heard in England, a High Court judge has ruled.

Serious congestion problems outside the Stade de France saw thousands of Liverpool fans penned in against perimeter fences and stuck in a motorway underpass ahead of the game against Real Madrid.

Those same supporters, who had already been targeted by local youths trying to steal tickets, were then tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed by police.

Image: Supporters covered their faces as they tried to get into the Stade de France. There were reports of police using pepper spray

In a hearing last July, UEFA argued that English courts do not have jurisdiction to deal with the claims.

The court in Liverpool heard it relied on a principle that English courts will not inquire into the legality of the acts of a foreign government.

However, in a 38-page judgment on Friday, Mr Justice Turner, said the case could be heard in England, adding: ""I have already concluded that, as a matter of English law, it is arguable that the combination of the limits of the scope of the application of the doctrine to the facts of this case as I have found them to be and the further constraints imposed by the operation of the first exception are sufficient in themselves fatally to undermine the defendants' jurisdiction application.""

Image: Liverpool supporters showing their tickets as they struggle to get into the Champions League final in Paris

He added that the fans say contractual claims brought by those who received their tickets from Liverpool FC ""involve the imposition of an English contractual duty to take reasonable skill and care to be considered in regard to French health and safety laws and regulations as applicable to the stadium"".

In March last year UEFA said it had reached a ""full and final settlement"" with supporters represented by two other law firms, who had made personal injury claims, before their claims got to court.

The continuing claims concern a group of hundreds of fans, represented by law firm Leigh Day.

In 2023, an independent report found UEFA bore ""primary responsibility"" for the failures which almost led to European club football's biggest occasion in Paris in May 2022 becoming a ""mass fatality catastrophe"".

Jill Paterson, one of the personal injury solicitors at Leigh Day who is representing the fans, said: ""This is a landmark legal decision for Liverpool fans in their battle for justice against UEFA.

""UEFA will now have to answer them in the English courts.

""All football fans should be able to attend matches safely.""

UEFA Statement

""UEFA today received the English High Court judgment on a preliminary challenge to a claim brought against it by supporters of Liverpool Football Club, in relation to the 2022 Champions League Final in Paris.

""UEFA had applied for the claim to be dismissed on the grounds that it requires an English court to consider the actions of the French police and other French authorities in a way that is not permitted by English law. That application was considered at a two-day hearing in Liverpool in July 2024.

""Today's judgment says that it is too early in the proceedings to know whether UEFA's position is correct or not. The Judgment says that UEFA's arguments will be revisited once more information is available.

""This is the only remaining claim brought by Liverpool fans in relation to the 2022 Champions League Final. The other two claims were resolved following discussions described by legal representatives of both sets of fans as ""constructive"".

""UEFA will not be providing any further comment at this stage.""",skysports.com,2025-03-07T18:40:00.000000Z,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13323631/liverpool-fans-claims-against-uefa-over-paris-2022-champions-league-final-chaos-can-be-heard-in-english-court-judge-rules
