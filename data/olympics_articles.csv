ecf491da-db12-409d-87cb-9bd8f3e1a950,Olympics: Baseball-softball among 5 additional sports in 2028,"KYODO NEWS - Oct 16, 2023 - 20:35 | Sports, Olympics, All

The International Olympic Committee on Monday confirmed baseball-softball, both won by Japan at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, among the five sports to be added to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

Cricket, lacrosse, squash and flag football -- a limited-contact version of American football -- were the four other sports ratified on the second day of the IOC session.

The IOC's Olympic program commission reviewed and put forward the LA28 Organizing Committee's proposal to the IOC's Executive Board before it was submitted to the session.

All five additional sports will feature six teams each in their respective men's and women's events.

Among the nine sports that were being considered by the 2028 local organizers, karate, motorsports and kickboxing were left out alongside breaking, also known as breakdancing, which will make its Olympic debut next summer in Paris.

Baseball and softball were both played in Tokyo but were not selected for the 2024 Games.

""I feel happy,"" Tokyo Olympics baseball manager Atsunori Inaba said of the sport's return to the Olympics. ""I hope that baseball will become more known around the world and more countries will play baseball.""

Cricket will be back in the Olympic program for the first time in 128 years and lacrosse in 120 years, while flag football and squash have never featured before.

""It will be a great chance for cricket to gain more attention and expand in Japan,"" said former professional baseball player Shogo Kimura, who now plays for the Tokyo-based Wyverns cricket club.

Cricket is hugely popular in South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and has an estimated 2.5 billion fans around the world.

Baseball-softball, both won by Japan at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, was listed among the five additional sports proposed Monday by the organizers of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

Cricket, flag football -- a limited-contact version of American football -- lacrosse and squash were the four other sports submitted by the LA28 Organizing Committee to the International Olympic Committee.

The IOC's Olympic Programme Commission will discuss the proposal and issue a recommendation to its Executive Board. If the recommendation is accepted, the board will present the proposal to the three-day IOC Session starting Sunday in Mumbai, India.

Among the nine sports that were being considered, karate, motorsports and kickboxing were left out, alongside breaking (breakdancing), which will make its Olympic debut next summer in Paris.

Baseball-softball was an additional sport at the Tokyo Olympics but was not selected for the 2024 Games.

Should they be picked, cricket will be back in the Olympic program for the first time in 128 years and lacrosse in 120 years.

Flag football and squash have never been contested at the Olympics.

96bcc139-40ef-412b-9e3f-a9a0e8f4e6bc,Candidate for Russian sports minister echoes government stance on 2024 Olympics,"MOSCOW, May 14. /TASS/. Russian sports officials should align themselves with the government’s stance regarding the participation of national athletes at the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, Mikhail Degtyarev, a candidate for the post of the Russian sports minister, said on Tuesday.

""Should our athletes participate in the [2024] Olympics? We will proceed from the stance assumed by the leadership of our country,"" he said addressing lawmakers of the Russian parliament’s lower house, the State Duma.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin nominated Mikhail Degtyarev, who has served as the governor of Russia’s Far Eastern Khabarovsk Territory since 2021, for the post of the country’s sports minister.

On May 12, the candidacy of Degtyarev was unanimously approved by members of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture and Sports.

In mid-December 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his combined Direct Line Q&A session and year-end press conference that recommendations regarding Russian athletes taking part in the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris must to be thoroughly analyzed and after considering everything, a decision regarding the country’s participation in the Olympics should follow.

The 2024 Summer Olympic Games will be hosted by the French capital of Paris between July 26 and August 11.

IOC’s regulations against Russia

The International Olympic Committee Executive Board convened for a meeting at the Olympic House in Lausanne, Switzerland, on March 19-20 and following the opening day it decided to bar athletes from Russia and Belarus from taking part in the Parade of Athletes and also exclude them from the 2024 Olympics overall medal standings.

The IOC, however, ruled that Russian athletes, cleared to participate in the upcoming Olympics, would not have to sign anything denouncing their country’s special military operation in Ukraine.

On October 12, 2023, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) until further notice after the Russian organization included the Olympic councils of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR), the Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions as its members.

The Swiss-based CAS registered on November 6, 2023 an appeal from the ROC against the IOC’s decision on the Russian governing Olympic body’s suspension.

The suspension means that the ROC cannot act as a national Olympic committee or receive financing from the Olympic movement. The IOC however reserved the right to clear Russian athletes to take part in the Olympic Games in Paris in 2024 as neutrals. Later, IOC President Thomas Bach said that Russian athletes should have no affiliation with the ROC if they want to compete at the Olympic Games.",tass.com,2024-05-14T13:22:27.000000Z,https://tass.com/sports/1787799
607fa2c7-5dad-4b9c-99ef-7c29caa61897,"Plenty of sports, but Olympics betting bump unlikely in 2024","Open Extended Reactions

The opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics is always a unique spectacle and 2024's edition promises to deliver with the world's elite athletes floating down the Seine River in a nautical Parade of Nations.

The procession will mark the first time that most of the event's competitors will be gathered together, and in the world of sports, that brings wildly varying levels of fame. Team USA flag-bearers LeBron James and Coco Gauff are well known to almost all American sports consumers, but many would likely struggle to name the majority of the other 590 athletes that comprise the team. In the United States, where legal sports betting has grown massively since the last Summer Games in 2021, this creates a special market for prospective bettors. It's not often that sportsbooks get to offer basketball games containing multiple NBA players on both sides in the same overarching event as fencing and rowing.

It's an opportunity for American bettors to, for once, diversify their portfolios and have fun with sports they wouldn't usually engage with. However the lack of knowledge base in these sports and less-than-ideal scheduling prevents most bettors from contributing to any kind of meaningful handle for the overall event.

""I don't expect the handle to be especially big primarily for one simple reason: Gamblers like to bet on things that they know,"" Jay Zagorsky, a clinical associate professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, told ESPN. ""When you don't know and you're betting just because it's something interesting to watch on TV, you're not going to put large amounts of money down.""

With football not starting for another month, baseball in its dog days and the WNBA taking a break for the Games, the Olympics represent a prime opportunity for larger sports betting activity during a time of year that is generally quite slow. But for as fun and unique as the Olympic offerings are, consumers aren't branching out.

The five-on-five basketball tournaments, both men's and women's, are projected to be -- by far -- the biggest drivers of handle for sportsbooks during the Olympics. Specifically, bettors are flocking to the dominant American teams, which feature superstars from the NBA and WNBA. DraftKings reports the men's squad as its most-bet team of the Olympics and the women's its third. BetMGM says USA Basketball is its largest handle driver ""by a mile.""

With the men's (-400) and women's (-1750) teams both prohibitive favorites to win gold medals in their respective events, DraftKings director of sportsbook Johnny Avello told ESPN that parlays featuring both teams have been a popular play among the public. Those odds-on favorite statuses have some bettors laying serious cash, as the men's team shows 86% of the money to win the gold, while the women's has 97% of the handle, per FanDuel.

Americans are, unsurprisingly, backing their compatriots, but other sports with familiar foreign athletes are sure to draw bets as well. The Spanish men's soccer team has attracted the second-most bets of any team at the Olympics, per DraftKings. Spain's senior team is fresh off a victory at Euro 2024, although it's their U-23 squad that will compete in Paris.

The tennis tournaments will provide a level of familiarity both with its players, like reigning French Open champions Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek, and its venue, the iconic Roland Garros. The same goes for golf, which will play its tournaments at Le Golf National, which hosted the 2018 Ryder Cup, and will feature reigning major champions Nelly Korda, Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele.

The presence of those familiar superstars, who take up so much viewing time and betting research during the nearly four years that Summer Olympic sports get much less limelight, leave little room in most bettors' bankrolls for anyone else.

""I see lots of people saying, 'Okay, we're watching the track and field, but since I haven't been watching track and field since the last Olympics, I don't know all the people in this race. I don't really know how to handicap the field, so I'll throw in five or 10 bucks, but I'm not throwing down $10,000 on the race,'"" Zagorsky said.

Similarly, with so many events happening simultaneously, the smaller sports may not be able to compete with the big ones when they're on at the same time, much in the way that postseason MLB games lose handle when they're matched up against the NFL in October. Two small or medium sized events happening at once could also split handle from each other.

It's also possible that the large and complex schedule of the Games could have some bettors missing out on events they may want to bet. It's something the sportsbooks will have to be aware of as they try to reach their customers, with push notifications on mobile apps likely becoming critical.

""If you're betting on football, there's one o'clock games and four o'clock games on the east coast, you have a schedule, in comparison to some of the Olympic games, where I think the scheduling may not be as well known for people,"" Gambling.com Group EVP of North America Max Bichsel told ESPN. ""It will be incumbent upon [the operators] to effectively become the TV guide of the Olympics for people that are betting on sports so that they're able to understand when the events are, because I'm sure they are interested.""

AP Photo/George Walker IV, File

As part of his recent research, which analyzed 40 years of betting financial data in Nevada and the United Kingdom, Zagorsky found that there was is no statistically significant ""Olympic bump"" for sportsbooks during years that the games are held.

This phenomenon rang especially true three years ago at the Covid-delayed 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The immense time zone difference, lack of spectators and general malaise coming out of the pandemic led to largely apathetic betting interest, with Avello unenthusiastically describing the action as just ""ok.""

Since then, 15 states have legalized sports betting in some form or fashion, including population powerhouses New York and Florida, though its legality is complicated. Additionally, the time difference from France to the U.S. will create much more advantageous live viewing in the morning and continuing through the middle of the day.

""This [year's Olympics] seems to fit in more for viewing and betting... So I think it's a better time to view and viewing means betting,"" Avello said. ""I think the last one in Tokyo, we were coming off of Covid and people were interested in getting back into it again, but I'm not sure that it grabbed the bettors as well as it could have. I think this one will do much better.""

Caesars Sportsbook says it expects ""to produce anywhere from 8-10 times the handle that we took for Tokyo 2020.""

To fully maximize, the books are going all out with their offerings. ESPN BET currently has over 300 Olympic markets available, with more to come as the games progress, and is using the event to debut offerings in field hockey, handball, badminton and water polo. The Olympic markets will also be different from what bettors are used to because they allow for wagering on the same athlete or team for multiple events, as well as betting on medal counts.

American sprinting stars Sha'Carri Richardson and Noah Lyles will each run in their individual events and participate in the 4x100m relay and are both among DraftKings' most-bet athletes thus far. But for the unprecedented number of options available and promotions that are sure to follow, Zagorsky's research still shows that the Olympics are not generally a big driver of handle, even with the convenient Western European location for American audiences.

""The popularity and the betting activity will naturally be greater than what you saw in the last Summer Games, but I don't think it's nearly to the point where it's a material impact on sportsbooks,"" says Bichsel. ""I think it's certainly not popular in comparison to weeks one through five of the NFL or the first weekend of March Madness or a Super Bowl, frankly, even with the Olympics taking place over several weeks.""

Regardless of handle, the two-week Olympics should provide a nice change of pace for both bettors and operators -- and an opportunity for many bettors to rally behind their country with their wallets.",espn.com,2024-07-25T12:59:33.000000Z,https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/40634601/2024-paris-olympics-betting-remain-cautious-summer-games
d2f6d2cf-6419-40ec-acb8-896b4e09b96b,WADA within rights to strip US of hosting 2028 Olympics — Russian sports chief,"MOSCOW, August 8. /TASS/. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is well within its rights to strip the United States of hosting the 2028 Olympics because its government meddled in the process of imposing sanctions on foreign athletes, Russian Sports Minister Mikhail Degtyarev told TASS on Thursday.

The United States Anti-Doping Agency's (USADA) compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code is set to be reviewed this month. This will mark the first time that WADA has filed an appeal with the Independent Compliance Court. The appeal comes in connection with the situation regarding the doping samples of Chinese swimmers.

""The government interfered in the process of sanctions against foreign athletes,"" the Russian sports minister said in an interview with TASS. ""All of this obviously got out of hand.""

""In line with WADA’s regulations the global agency should simply ban the US anti-doping agency and the next scheduled Olympics should be relocated to another country,"" Degtyarev stated.

The US city of Los Angeles is set to host the 2028 Olympics, Italian cities Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo will host the 2026 Winter Olympics and Australia’s Brisbane will be home to the 2032 Summer Games.

""Remember that the FBI directly intervened by launching criminal cases against Chinese athletes. There was no need to resort to the 'Rodchenkov Act' as everything was already on the table. We will see what comes next,"" the Russian sports minister added.

On April 21, The New York Times daily reported that 23 top Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance, the drug trimetazidine (TMZ), seven months prior to the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) later said that it never punished the Chinese athletes because it could not refute information from the China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) that the athletes had been exposed to the prohibited substance inadvertently.

At that time, the CEO of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), Travis Tygart, accused the global anti-doping body and China’s anti-doping regulator of deliberately concealing the positive test results.

The Chinese side acknowledged that the swimmers had ingested the banned drug unwittingly and in tiny amounts and that this warranted no action against them, the NYT said. A probe by the Chinese antidoping regulator showed that contamination might have been the source of TMZ.

Early last month, Xinhua news agency reported citing an independent prosecutor’s report, that ""The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) did not show ‘favoritism or deference, or in any way favored’ the 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ) due to food contamination in 2021.""

According to the Chinese news agency, ""WADA held an online extraordinary Executive meeting on Tuesday [July 9] in Montreal discussing the interim report delivered by Independent Prosecutor Eric Cottier, regarding his review of WADA's handling of the China Anti-Doping Agency's (CHINADA's) no-fault contamination case involving 23 swimmers from China in 2021… In the report, Cottier concluded that WADA had been unbiased and reasonable in handling the case.""",tass.com,2024-08-08T14:16:59.000000Z,https://tass.com/sports/1826735

The Paris Olympics will offer Comcast another chance to lift its streaming platform, Peacock, as it aims to not only attract more subscribers but keep them. Although this Olympics is the third since Peacock debuted in 2020, it's becoming the first real opportunity for Comcast's NBCUniversal, CNBC's parent company, to use its long-standing U.S. media rights to boost the streaming service. ""In some ways, Comcast is starting with a clean slate, in that this will be the first Olympics for Peacock since the games were blown up by the pandemic and distorted time zones,"" said analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. ""But they've also had the opportunity to learn quite a bit, so they will be much better prepared for capitalizing on the Olympics than before."" There are a handful of reasons this Olympics looks better for Peacock than recent Games, such as the favorable time zone — Paris is six hours ahead of the East Coast in the U.S., versus 13 hours for Tokyo in 2021. The end of the restrictions from the early days of the Covid pandemic is also a big factor, along with the allure of the host city of Paris. But most importantly, Peacock will air the entirety of the Summer Olympics for the first time. ""It was different times, since Peacock didn't have the rights to show all of the Olympics back in 2021,"" said Molly Solomon, NBC's executive producer of the Olympics. ""But we're in a different era of streaming with rights deals. Peacock is now the streaming home of the Olympics, and there's no limits if you're a super fan or casual fan, since it will all be available on Peacock."" Some fans were confused during the 2021 Summer Games in Tokyo about what exactly was available live on the streaming platform. ""I don't know that there is a great comparison to be made,"" said Kelly Campbell, president of Peacock. ""This will be the most comprehensive Olympic destination in U.S. history."" The Olympics come at an important moment for Peacock, as legacy media companies are pushing for their streaming services to retain customers and become profitable in a tumultuous industry landscape. Live sports, in particular, have drawn the most viewership to traditional TV and streaming.

Olympics TV gold

The Olympics have long been a big part of NBCUniversal's sports portfolio. The relationship dates back to 1936, when NBC Radio covered the events. NBC first broadcast the games during the 1964 Summer Olympics. Paris marks NBC's 18th Olympic Games. Comcast paid $7.65 billion to renew its media rights deal through 2032. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which were held in 2021 due to the Covid pandemic, drew the lowest-ever audience for the Summer Games. The Beijing Olympics in 2022 had the lowest viewership ever for the Winter Games, which are notably smaller than the Summer Olympics. Between the favorable time difference and the backdrop of France this year — for instance, the opening ceremony will air Friday afternoon from along the Seine River, the equestrian teams will compete at the Palace of Versailles, and beach volleyball will be played next to the Eiffel Tower — NBCUniversal and others are betting on a return to big viewership for the Olympics. A majority of U.S consumers are expecting to watch the Olympics this year, with 60% likely to stream the Games and 47% planning to watch on traditional TV, according to Numerator's recent survey of more than 10,000 consumers. Also, advertisers have been flocking to the Paris Games. NBCUniversal said in April it had already sold more than $1.2 billion in advertising for the Summer Games, a record for the Olympics. Ad-supported streamers, including Peacock, and digital companies have seen an influx of ad dollars as the market rebounds. While competitions will play out live during the day in the U.S., NBC has branded the evening as ""Primetime in Paris"" and will replay big events along with in-depth programming such as interviews. Overall, there will be more hours of the Olympics on broadcast network NBC than in previous years, and cable networks including USA will also feature a lot of live content. Every event will be live on Peacock and available to replay, so fans can watch the entirety of the Games without a traditional cable TV subscription. Plus, the U.S. audience is likely to tune in for events such as men's and women's basketball, which both include star-studded lineups; Simone Biles' final run with the gymnastics team, and the U.S. swim team's heated rivalry with Australia. ""I'm sure basketball will tell its own story in terms of ratings and everyone watching, but [the] no-guaranteed-big-victory part of this is something that will keep everyone watching when Team USA plays in men's basketball,"" NBC prime-time and daytime Olympic host Mike Tirico said during a press call this week, referencing the fact that the U.S. men's basketball team faces a tougher path than ever to a gold medal.

The Olympics will return to ""normal"" in Paris after the previous two editions, one summer and one winter, in which spectators from around the world were shut out due to the coronavirus pandemic.

At the games that open Friday, Japanese athletes have strong chances of winning gold medals in urban sports such as skateboarding and breaking, also known as breakdancing, while having few prospects for success in swimming.

When questions were being raised about whether the postponed Tokyo Games should go ahead at all in 2021 during one of the hardest phases of the pandemic, young skateboarders Yuto Horigome, Sakura Yosozumi and Momiji Nishiya gave the host country something to cheer by winning gold in the sport's Olympic debut.

Horigome and Yosozumi will be out to defend the men's street and women's park titles, respectively, about a month after the 16-year-old Nishiya lost out to her domestic rivals in an intense qualifying race for Japan's three-woman street skateboarding team.

Having already made his name in the skateboarding world, 14-year-prodigy Ginwoo Onodera is poised to take his fame to another level at his first Olympics.

Onodera topped the street qualifying rankings that were led by three Japanese, outperforming global street skateboarding icon Nyjah Huston, who ranked sixth, second best among Americans behind No. 4 Jagger Eaton.

""I feel the same (as always),"" Onodera said after training Tuesday at the competition venue, La Concorde. ""I'm not in a special mode for the Olympics. It feels like just another competition to me.""

""I don't really care about conditions such as the weather. I'll be fine even if it gets hot on the day of my event. I just want to enjoy it and show my style of skateboarding.""

In the Olympic debut of breaking, two b-boys Shigeyuki Nakarai and Hiroto Ono as well as two b-girls Ami Yuasa and Ayumi Fukushima will look to battle for podium spots.

Nakarai, runner-up at the 2022 world championships whose stage name is Shigekix, wants to outperform long-time rivals such as Victor Montalvo of the United States and Canada's Philip Kim, known as Phil Wizard. Performers usually compete under their stage names.

""It's best if my performance can create some exciting moments for everyone,"" Shigekix told a press conference in Tokyo last Saturday.

Two-time world champion Ami and 41-year-old Ayumi, the 2021 champion and 2023 runner-up to Lithuanian teenager Dominika Banevic at worlds, have set their sights on the top step of the podium.

In swimming, Japan hopes to regain its footing after struggling at international competitions in recent years, including the home world championships last July in Fukuoka where Japan managed only two bronze while being shut out of gold for the second worlds in a row.

Rikako Ikee, who went from a leukemia diagnosis in February 2019 to competing at the Tokyo Olympics in three relay events, will contest the women's 100-meter butterfly.

""I want to make the final,"" the 24-year-old Ikee said. ""I have to admit that I'm worried because my rivals keep raising the bar, but I'm telling myself that there is nothing to lose. I'm ready to take on the world's best.""

Yui Ohashi will stand on the starting block in the women's 200-meter individual medley after winning a 200-400 IM double at her home Olympics.

On the men's side, French swimming superstar Leon Marchand will face Tomoru Honda in the men's 200-meter butterfly and Daiya Seto in the 200- and 400-meter individual medleys.

In judo, one of the most popular sports in France, Japan is looking to build on its record nine-gold performance at the Tokyo Games.

Hifumi Abe and his younger sister Uta will bid for gold on the same day again -- in the men's 66-kilogram and the women's 52-kg contests on July 28.

There will likely be marquee matchups between veteran host country favorite Teddy Riner and Tatsuru Saito in the men's over 100-kilogram category and between their countries in the mixed team event, in which France defeated Japan in the final of the previous Olympics.

In gymnastics, Daiki Hashimoto will try to not only retain his all-around and horizontal bar titles but also to carry a big load in an expected showdown with China in the men's team event.

Akari Fujinami is set to extend her 133-match winning streak in the women's 53-kilogram wrestling in her chase for Olympic gold.

Other Japanese athletes to watch are Haruka Kitaguchi and Misaki Emura, the women's javelin throw and individual sabre fencing world champions, respectively, as well as Abdul Hakim Sani Brown, who aims to reach the men's 100-meter final after doing so at the last two world championships.

Sani Brown finished seventh in 2022 and sixth last year.

As for team sports, Japan's basketball and volleyball teams have gained ever-increasing attention at home.

While all eyes are on the U.S. men's basketball team featuring NBA stars LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, Japan will try to achieve its goal of reaching the last eight, with Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe leading the way.

In volleyball, the Japanese men's and women's teams showed positive signs in the run-up to the Olympics as they both reached but lost their respective Nations League finals.

According to the organizing committee for Paris 2024, North Korea will have 12 female and four male athletes in artistic gymnastics, athletics, boxing, swimming, diving, judo, table tennis and wrestling.

North Korea will have its biggest representation in wrestling with five athletes, followed by three athletes each in table tennis and diving.

North Korea skipped the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, citing concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. The International Olympic Committee then suspended North Korea from international competitions until the end of 2022, while also cutting off financial aid.

After the ban was lifted, the reclusive country competed at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, last fall, and will return to the Summer Olympics this month for the first time since 2016.

In 2016, North Korea grabbed two gold, three silver and two bronze medals to finish 34th in the medal table.

Artistic gymnast An Chang-ok, the reigning Asian Games gold medalist in the women's vault and uneven bars, will be among the dozen female athletes for North Korea.

They are eager to compete but say their presence at the Games isn’t only, or even primarily, about sports. With Israel and Hamas locked in a brutal war that has killed tens of thousands in Gaza, these eight athletes — two of whom hail from the West Bank — carry heavier burdens.

The 2024 Olympics are just days away.

Across an array of sports, 10,000 top athletes will battle it out for a coveted medal - and the right to be called an Olympic champion.

Here is all you need to know about dates, tickets, the schedule and more.

Where are the 2024 Olympics going to be held?

This year, the Olympics will be held in France, with most of the competitions being held in Paris and its surrounds.

Temporary venues are being set up throughout the city, including a stadium beside the Eiffel Tower and an open-air arena at the Place de la Concorde. (For history buffs, that's the site of Marie Antoinette's execution.)

The former will host beach volleyball, while the latter will become the home for urban sports, including 3x3 basketball, breaking (also known as breakdancing), skateboarding and freestyle BMX.

Just north of Paris, the Stade de France will host rugby, athletics and the closing ceremony, while equestrian events and the modern pentathlon will be held at the glittering Palace of Versailles, about 21km from the city.

Not all of the events will be held in or near the City of Lights. Basketball and handball will be played at Villeneuve-d'Ascq in northern France and football heats will be played at stadiums throughout the country, including Bordeaux, Lyon, Nantes and Nice.

Sailing races will be held in Marseilles, on the Mediterranean coast, while the surfing competition will be held in Teahupo'o, on the southwestern coast of Tahiti (part of French Polynesia).

How many times has Paris hosted the Olympics?

This is the third time Paris will host the Summer Olympics. It previously hosted in 1900 and 1924.

When are the Paris Olympics?

The Olympics will be held from 27 July to 12 August NZT, with the opening ceremony beginning at 5.30am on 27 July.

However, some competitions with multiple heats will begin prior to the opening ceremony. Football and rugby sevens will begin on 25 July NZT and archery and handball on 26 July.

How much are Paris Olympics tickets?

Tickets to watch many competitions are already sold out at time of writing, but there are plenty still available for some sports, including football and rugby sevens.

The cheapest tickets available are for the football heats and will set you back €24 (NZ$43).

A ticket to a rugby sevens pool round are available for €24 (NZ$43), while handball preliminaries are from €140 (NZ$253), rowing heats are from €65 (NZ$117) and canoe slalom heats are from €24 (NZ$43).

Tickets cost more as the competition progresses. For example, tickets to the men's swimming semi-final are €690 (NZ$1250).

At the most expensive end of the scale, hospitality packages - including lounge access, food, drinks and entertainment - are still available for a select number of sports and cost up to €1995 (NZ$3613).

Where can I buy Paris Olympics tickets?

Tickets can be bought from the official 2024 Olympics site.

People are being warned only to buy from there, as those who purchase tickets from other websites may be denied entry.

What sports will be played at the 2024 Olympics?

The sports being played at this year's Olympics are: archery, gymnastics (both artistic and rhythmic), artistic swimming, athletics, badminton, basketball (both 5x5 and 3x3), beach volleyball, boxing, breaking, canoeing (slalom and sprint), cycling (BMX freestyle, BMX racing, mountain biking, road cycling and track cycling), diving, equestrian, fencing, football, golf, handball, hockey, judo, marathon swimming, modern pentathlon, rowing, rugby sevens, sailing, shooting, skateboarding, sport climbing, surfing, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, trampoline, triathlon, volleyball, water polo, weightlifting and wrestling.

Which sports will be new at the 2024 Olympics?

Breaking is the only sport having its Summer Olympics debut this year. It was previously held at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires.

Sixteen B-Boys and 16 B-Girls will face off in solo battles, with a panel of judges awarding each breaker points for creativity, personality, technique, variety, style and musicality. The breaker with the highest points is declared the winner.

Surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing have all been added to the Paris Olympics lineup after successful debuts at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

When is the opening ceremony and what will it look like?

The opening ceremony will be held on the evening of 26 July in the centre of Paris. For those watching from New Zealand, it will run from 5.30am-9.15am on 27 July.

For the first time in the history of the modern Summer Olympics, the opening ceremony will take place outdoors. Ten thousand athletes will wind their way down the Seine on boats, finishing at the Trocadéro Gardens where the final formalities will take place.

If you're travelling to France and hoping to catch the opening ceremony, you're in luck: there is no admission fee for most spectators and you do not need a ticket to access the upper quays of the river. However, you'd be advised to get there well in advance to secure a spot, as about 300,000 people are expected to attend.

Those wishing to watch the ceremony from the lower quays will need to buy tickets, which are available at time of writing for €900-€2700 (NZ$1627-$4890) from the official site.

How can I watch the 2024 Olympics?

Sky has the New Zealand broadcast rights for the 2024 Olympics, including the opening ceremony.

Sky will have 12 channels dedicated to the games. Some will be screened on Sky Open, which is free-to-air.

How can I find out the schedule for the Olympic Games?

The full schedule can be found here.

It is subject to change right up until the end of the games, so check back regularly to ensure you don't miss your favourite athletes in action.

When and where will the next winter and summer Olympics be held?

The next Winter Olympics will be hosted by the Italian cities of Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo from 6-22 February 2026 (local time).

The next Summer Olympics will be held in Los Angeles, California from 14-30 July 2028 (local time).",rnz.co.nz,2024-04-28T22:18:31.000000Z,https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/sport/515434/olympics-2024-what-you-need-to-know-about-dates-tickets-sports-the-schedule-and-opening-ceremony
71b08b6a-c4d7-451a-aa76-9b9b2578a2b0,IOC threatens Afghanistan's Paris Olympics status as Taliban blocks women's sports access,"The Afghanistan team's status for the 2024 Paris Olympics was put in question Wednesday by the IOC over growing frustration with the Taliban blocking access to sport for women and girls.

The International Olympic Committee said it ""continues to be extremely concerned"" about the sports situation in Afghanistan despite its repeated calls for action.

Noting its ""right to take any further measures,"" the IOC cautioned that ""specific details for the participation of the Afghan (national Olympic committee) delegation and team"" for the Paris Games have not yet been decided.

The IOC could suspend Afghanistan's Olympic body for government interference in the independent management of sport, while supporting the country's athletes to compete in Paris as an independent team under the Olympic flag and anthem. That was how Kuwaitis competed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

The issue was discussed Wednesday at an IOC executive board meeting which also took updates on problems with Olympic officials in India, Indonesia, Iran and Guatemala.

A call between Olympic officials and Afghanistan's recently appointed director of physical education and sports had led to some written guarantees, IOC director for NOC relations James McLeod said in an online briefing.

Still, the IOC said allowing some access to sports for girls at primary schools was ""a first step but reiterated that this remains insufficient.""

A number of women and girls who once played a variety of sports told The Associated Press in January they had been intimidated by the Taliban with visits and phone calls warning them not to engage in their sports.

The Afghanistan issue is next scheduled to be discussed in October at an IOC board meeting held in Mumbai, India, soon after the Asian Games.

Afghanistan sent five athletes, including one woman, to the Tokyo Olympics, which ended in August 2021 one week before the Taliban retook control of the country.

Indonesia

The IOC has cautioned Olympic sports bodies about letting Indonesia host their events, McLeod confirmed.

Indonesia was stripped by FIFA in March of hosting the men's soccer Under-20 World Cup just seven weeks before it started because the country did not want Israel to play.

Israel had qualified for the tournament nine months earlier but does not have formal diplomatic relations with Indonesia, which is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation.

McLeod said the IOC advised sports bodies ""to be very careful in their allocation of events"" to nations which restricted access to athletes.

Indonesia is due to host the World Beach Games in Bali in August for the global umbrella group of national Olympic bodies, known as ANOC. McLeod said the IOC told ANOC to ""look at this situation very closely.""

Russia's Isinbayeva cleared

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine started 16 months ago, the IOC has faced questions about letting Russian members take part in Olympic business.

Yelena Isinbayeva, the two-time Olympic pole vault champion and long-time Russian army officer, has now been cleared by the IOC ethics commission to continue using the IOC membership she has had since 2016.

The IOC had said in March her membership status was to be evaluated after Olympic sports bodies were advised that athletes who supported the war in Ukraine or were contracted to the military should not get neutral status to compete internationally.

Without saying Isinbayeva's name on Wednesday, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the ""past contractual situation"" of Russians prior to the war starting on Feb. 24 last year should not be taken into consideration.

""All the necessary work has been carried out to the satisfaction of the ethics commission,"" Adams said, without clarifying if Isinbayeva has renounced her army rank.",cbc.ca,2023-06-21T19:52:11.000000Z,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/olympics-ioc-warns-afghanistan-denying-women-sport-1.6884102?cmp=rss

b34034ff-cb3e-428b-9d0e-c47591c1617f,The Paris Olympics horse-whipping scandal shows the dangers of ‘Disneyfication’ in horse sports,"Over the course of the 2024 Paris Olympics, Charlotte Dujardin went from being Great Britain’s most successful Olympics dressage rider to one of the most digitally shamed athletes in the history of the internet.

A video emerged which not only damaged Dujardin’s career but reignited debate around horse welfare in elite horse sports.

By the time the video was published online by mainstream media, it had already gone viral on Facebook.

The video shows Dujardin deliberately striking the legs of a student’s horse multiple times with a whip during a training session.

The footage is actually four years old, and questions have to be asked about the timing of its release during the Olympics. But both Dujardin, and elite level dressage, are now under intense public scrutiny.

The fallout

On her Facebook page, Dujardin apologised and withdrew from the Paris games.

She admitted she felt “deeply ashamed,” and acknowledged she should have “set a better example.”

But this did not stop the merciless online mobbing. Much of it came from fellow dressage riders desperate to distance themselves from what appears to be animal abuse.

The fallout has been immense.

Some activists and social media commentators have targeted other Olympic riders and the brands that sponsor them.

An online petition has also been started to remove horses from the Olympics.

On the other hand, some riders have taken issue with the treatment of Dujardin, claiming she has been unfairly framed. Some supporters have united on social media under the hashtag #istandwithcharlotte.

What are rule-makers doing?

At the time of writing, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) is investigating the Dujardin incident. On its website the FEI is very clear about its commitment to prioritising horse welfare in horse sports.

Excessive use of whips is already prohibited in most horse sports.

Long before Paris 2024, reports recommended strengthening surveillance with regard to horse health and wellbeing in the Olympics. But how this would be enforced in private training barns is not clear.

The FEI has also been criticised for perceived failings in its response to earlier scandals, such as in 2021 when the coach of Germany’s modern pentathlon team was disqualified from the Tokyo Olympics for punching a horse.

That shameful scene was painful to watch but it should invoke some compassion for both horse and rider, who were clearly both suffering.

Why would a rider need to whip a horse?

In analysing the situation, it is time to move the discussion beyond online public shaming to consider animal agency and horse welfare.

Perhaps wisely, Dujardin has not attempted to explain or excuse her actions in her public statements so far. But this means we don’t know why she whipped the horse in the training session.

It is possible she was training the horse to perform the kind of extravagant movement which is routinely rewarded in dressage scores at the elite level.

Sadly, there are many more horses who suffer far worse abuse in other industries and settings, much of it also caught on film.

The reason Dujardin was dragged into a maelstrom of digital shaming so quickly was due in part to the special, emotional place of the show horse in our popular culture.

It was also due in part to who she is or was: a global sports celebrity who embodied the hopes and dreams of her fans.

Back in 2012 Dujardin was a hero – not just for winning gold in London. She also achieved the seemingly impossible feat of rising to the top of the international dressage scene without the financial and political backing of a wealthy family.

The horse she rode so elegantly, Valegro, also looked like he had stepped out of a fairytale.

The dangers of ‘Disneyfication’

Everyone in horse sports says they want to improve welfare standards and put horses first.

Those raised on Disney images of anthropomorphised horses might like to imagine these majestic creatures naturally choose to “dance” with their beloved owners to music in the dressage arena. But horses have to be trained to “dance” in this way, usually through the application of artificial aids and pressure.

Ironically, Dujardin herself had previously profited significantly from the wider “Disneyfication” of horses in our culture. In happier times, that collective fantasy fed into her narrative and celebrity brand as “The Girl on the Dancing Horse”.

Both social media and the mainstream media have long invested in stereotypical misrepresentations of female athletes as either magical princesses or ghastly villains.

A compassionate, multispecies approach to welfare would not treat horses as tools or trophies. Nor would it put human emotions and desires at the centre of horse welfare issues.

All of this is a stark reminder that it is humans, not horses, who dream of Olympic gold and glory.",theconversation.com,2024-08-09T03:51:16.000000Z,https://theconversation.com/the-paris-olympics-horse-whipping-scandal-shows-the-dangers-of-disneyfication-in-horse-sports-235672
05eb91aa-06e3-40b4-b3c6-cd19d7493df4,Paris Olympics promote sustainability for good reason: Climate change is putting athletes and their sports at risk,"Europe is in the midst of a heat wave, and while Olympic athletes in Paris for the 2024 Summer Games might be spared the worst of it, the weather will still be hot.

As global temperatures have risen, major sporting events like the Olympics and FIFA World Cup have had to adapt to high heat and extreme storms to keep athletes and fans safe and allow the games to go on.

Olympic organizers have moved events such as marathons to early mornings and even to cooler cities. FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, pushed the 2022 Men’s World Cup back from its usual time in June to late November so it could be held in Qatar.

The heat risks and the environmental impact of major sporting events have led some people to question whether these events should be held at all. But as someone who studies sport management and sustainability in an area I coined “sport ecology,” I believe that radical approach misses the benefits, including the Olympics’ ability to promote sustainable actions to the public worldwide.

How rising global heat affects the Olympics

Sports have good reason for caring about sustainability: Climate change can put athletes’ and fans’ health at risk and even put the future of some sports in doubt.

Winter sports face the greatest threats from climate change as temperatures rise and precipitation changes, dramatically shortening winter sports seasons in many areas. In 2022, the Beijing Winter Games had to artificially create snow so it could have ski runs at all. The International Olympic Committee has delayed its decision to select Winter Games host cities for 2030 and beyond because of the uncertainty of winter sports.

In the summer, global warming fuels extreme heat and storms that can affect the quality of the competition and the health of the athletes and spectators.

Major sport federations and leagues, as well as the Olympics, have responded to the risks by delaying competitions to cooler times of day or year, implementing water breaks and offering more player substitutions.

Organizers of the Tokyo Summer Games, held amid a fierce heat wave in 2021, had preemptively moved the marathon to Sapporo, more than 500 miles north of Tokyo, so athletes could run in cooler weather. They also delayed competitions during the Games to avoid extreme heat and excessive rain.

Olympic progress toward sustainability

Any large event like the Olympics can produce vast carbon emissions through its construction, transportation needs and energy use.

That impact, and the risks it creates for sports and their athletes, are why sustainability has been a pillar of the Olympic charter since 1996 and is a focus of its planning for the future. In 2012, the London Olympics pioneered a new international certification standard, ISO2012, which provides guidelines for any large event to make more sustainable choices, from construction to catering.

The 2024 Paris Games, from July 26 to Aug. 11, and Paralympic Games, Aug. 28 to Sept. 8, are certified to the latest standard, and organizers are taking many steps to reduce their climate impact.

The organizers plan to power the events’ operations with 100% renewable energy from wind and solar. They are using existing venues when possible, had new ones built with low-carbon concrete and recycled materials, and brought in thousands of seats made of recycled plastic.

All furniture and temporary buildings approved for the Games also must have a contractually guaranteed second life, rather than going into a landfill. All of the competition venues are on public transportation, allowing for fewer vehicles in the streets. Even the food is targeted for a 50% emissions cut compared with the average meal by increasing the use of plant-based foods. The Paralympics will use the same venues and housing in the weeks that follow.

That doesn’t mean the 2024 Olympics won’t have a large carbon footprint, however, particularly as many spectators and athletes arrive by plane. But the organizers are aiming for the construction and operations emissions to be half those of the London and Rio Games in 2012 and 2016.

World’s fair of sustainability

The Paris Olympic Games is an example of what large sporting events can do to reduce their impact on the environment and promote sustainability solutions to a global audience. Spectators will experience sustainability firsthand, and organizers will promote the Games’ sustainability efforts.

Such campaigns can influence people’s everyday behaviors and even increase their advocacy for sustainability in their home communities.

Suggestions to reduce the scale and size of sports events or even eliminate commercialized sports, ending spectator sports as we know them, overlook the ability of sports to influence and change human behavior.

Sustainability is a constantly evolving process of learning from the past to improve for the future.

The 2024 Olympics’ strategies, building on those used in previous events, and what Paris learns in carrying them out, will also help in planning for future events, including the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.

In essence, the Olympic Games, the largest sporting event in the world, is a sport sustainability world’s fair. It highlights what is possible for a sporting event through collaborations with international corporations to reduce its environmental impact. And it influences others to follow suit, whether that is other sporting events, leagues and federations or spectators from around the world.",theconversation.com,2024-07-24T19:28:59.000000Z,https://theconversation.com/paris-olympics-promote-sustainability-for-good-reason-climate-change-is-putting-athletes-and-their-sports-at-risk-235075

India's bid to host the 2036 Olympic Games is a massive opportunity to ""turbo-charge"" investment in its infrastructure but it must ensure the benefits are shared across local communities, a sports governance expert said.The world's most populous nation has never hosted the Olympics, though New Delhi staged the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982 as well as the Commonwealth Games in 2010.The city of Ahmedabad in the western state of Gujarat is expected to be at the centre of India's plans to host the Games but a multi-city bid cannot be ruled out.Former FIFA Council member Moya Dodd , who previously served on the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Athlete Entourage Commission, said developing the facilities needed to host the Olympics would have long-term benefits for the country.""Leaving the voting politics aside, it's a great opportunity to turbo-charge investment into sports infrastructure that'll be able to bear fruit for many years to come,"" Dodd said during the RCB Innovation Lab Indian Sports Summit on Friday.""Making sure those investments are the right ones in the right places, serving the right people, and taking a holistic view of that is a big opportunity, not just in hosting rights but also to improve communities that will be hosts.""Indonesia, Turkey and Chile have confirmed their intention to compete for the 2036 hosting rights, while several other countries including Egypt and South Korea are also expected to join the race.Former Australian soccer player Dodd said there had to be a legacy from hosting the Games.""It's important to ensure that the model imposed isn't one that's purely extractive of that country but one that's holistic and uplifts and leaves not just a legacy afterwards but actually delivers benefits along the way,"" she added.""That's important because we say that sport is this great phenomenon that is so wonderful and it's healthy and it's good for us all. Let's make sure that it doesn't bring suffering or disadvantage to anybody because of a major event that's come.""India has performed poorly at the Olympics, winning a total of 41 medals to date. The seven it bagged in Tokyo four years ago remains its biggest haul from a single Games.The country has won 10 gold medals, eight from hockey between 1928-1980, with one each from athletics and shooting.Former India hockey captain PR Sreejesh, who helped the team seal bronze medals in Tokyo 2021 and Paris 2024, said investment was needed to nurture the next generation of athletes.""At the grassroots level, there's a lot to work on,"" said Sreejesh, who retired after the Paris Games and now coaches India's junior men's team.""That's where the investment needs to go. If we're speaking about the 2036 Olympics, now is when we need to tap into talent between the age groups of 12-14 years.""",economictimes.indiatimes.com,2025-03-15T05:57:51.000000Z,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/olympics-2036-indias-2036-games-bid-a-chance-to-boost-infrastructure-says-sports-governance-expert/articleshow/119034006.cms

a63ad285-a0d1-45f7-83a7-7576c51b5fe4,"6 months from Olympics, Russians qualifying in some sports and absent in others","With just six months to go until the Paris Olympics, it's still not clear if Russians will be competing and, if so, how many.

Russians are qualifying for Olympic spots as ""neutral athletes"" in combat events such as judo and wrestling, but not in some of the Games' highest-profile events like track and field, swimming and gymnastics.

Russia is unhappy its competitors will compete without the national flag or anthem, and President Vladimir Putin said last month Russia was yet to decide whether to send athletes to the Paris Games, which start on July 26.

Ukrainian athletes are angered by what they see as some sports bodies bending the rules to allow Russians who support the war or have ties to the military to compete as ""neutrals.""

If Russians compete in Paris, there will be tension, just like at the world fencing championships, an Olympic qualifier, when Ukrainian fencer Olga Kharlan refused to shake hands after beating Russian ""neutral"" Anna Smirnova.

Smirnova staged a sitdown protest until the Ukrainian was disqualified, but the International Olympic Committee intervened and granted Kharlan a ""unique exception"" to compete at the Olympics.

How Russians can qualify

The IOC last year set up an ""Individual Neutral Athlete"" program for athletes from Russia and its military ally Belarus. They both were suspended from most Olympic sports a year earlier over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The process is run by the sports federations which organize their own qualifying competitions. The IOC wants them to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes who are employed by the military or security services or who posted on social media supporting the war. The multitude of different rules across the Games' 32 sports mean exact numbers of those with ""neutral"" status are hard to verify.

The IOC says six Russians and five Belarusians have already qualified for Paris. There are many more qualifying events to come.

The IOC will appoint ""independent analysts"" for its own vetting, spokesman Mark Adams said last week.

""You can have some confidence that those people who have qualified will have already been through one process and then will be going through a second process run by the IOC but using an independent organization,"" Adams said.

Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov told state news agency RIA Novosti on Wednesday he expected ""much stricter"" conditions and suggested the extra vetting meant the IOC ""doesn't fully trust the international sports federations.""

Which sports are Russians competing in?

Combat sports were especially enthusiastic about bringing back Russian competitors. Judo, fencing, wrestling and taekwondo led the way in admitting ""neutral athletes"" in 2023 and Russians have regularly competed in their Olympic qualifying events.

Different Russian sports bodies have taken varying approaches to the ""neutral athlete"" system, and there hasn't been a final decision from the government. Putin expressed concern in December that the rules could leave too many of Russia's top athletes ""cut out"" of the Games.

Influential gymnastics coach Valentina Rodionenko has told Russian media that Russia shouldn't enter World Cups unless the criteria are relaxed. International Gymnastics Federation records show it's granted ""neutral"" status to 30 people from Belarus including athletes, coaches and officials, but no Russians.

There are also no Russians expected to compete at the world swimming championships in Qatar next month, a key Olympic qualifier, though Belarus is set to send five swimmers.

The Russian governing bodies for gymnastics and swimming did not respond to a request for comment on whether any applications were filed for their athletes.

Russia has skipped Olympic weightlifting qualifiers in protest at a demand to sign a declaration which includes a pledge ""to abstain from expressing any support to the war."" Belarus has competed in those events.

Track and field never lifted its ban on Russian athletes. The IOC is blocking Russia and Belarus from team sports such as soccer, basketball or volleyball because it argues their involvement should be in ""individual"" events only, not as part of squads representing the country. Tennis doubles or two-person rowing crews might be approved, though.

Ukraine's concerns

Are sports federations following the rules? Ukraine says no.

More than 200 Ukrainian athletes including top soccer player Mykhailo Mudryk and high jump world champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh signed an open letter to French President Emmanuel Macron this month alleging three Russians who qualified for the Olympics as ""neutrals"" expressed support for the war.

""Allowing athletes from aggressor countries, who openly support Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine, violates the fundamental ethical principles declared by the Olympic Charter,"" the letter said.

Ukraine still opposes the IOC push for Russians to compete as neutrals but in July it dropped a policy that forced Ukrainian athletes to boycott events rather than compete against them.

Two Olympic gold medallists in taekwondo accused of posting on social media in support of the war were handed a ""probation period"" of three months by World Taekwondo but allowed to compete after that. United World Wrestling let three Olympic champions from Russia take part in its world championships because it judged they had been pressured into appearing at a pro-war rally in Moscow attended by Putin.

Switching nationality

At least some athletes from Russia — and who competed for Russia before the war — could be in Paris on the host French team.

There's European swimming champion Anastasiia Kirpichnikova, who switched allegiance from Russia to France in April, and Moscow-born Varvara Gracheva, who started representing France in June and has become France's second-highest ranked tennis player.",cbc.ca,2024-01-25T17:55:24.000000Z,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/olympics-russia-participation-1.7094590?cmp=rss

More than 400 Japanese athletes are set to compete at the Paris Olympics this summer, the largest ever for the country at an Olympics held abroad, the Japanese Olympic Committee revealed Monday.

The number will surpass a record-high 339 seen at the 2008 Beijing Olympics as Japan qualified in team sports such as basketball, football and volleyball.

The country qualified at least one team in either the men's or women's competition of each team ball sport.

Japan has set a target of 20 gold medals, with its strength in judo, wrestling and urban sports, such as skateboarding.

At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, 583 athletes represented the host country, and Japan won a record 27 gold medals.

A former executive of the Tokyo Olympics organizing committee on Thursday pleaded not guilty to receiving bribes totaling around 198 million yen ($1.4 million) in connection with the 2021 Summer Games.

Haruyuki Takahashi said he is ""innocent"" of all charges at the opening of his trial at the Tokyo District Court. The 79-year-old is accused of receiving bribes from five different sources between 2017 and 2022 in return for helping companies land Olympic sponsorships.

Takahashi, a former senior managing director of Japan's largest advertising agency Dentsu Inc., was considered an authority on the sports business.

He is believed to have received bribes from business suit retailer Aoki Holdings Inc. and publisher Kadokawa Corp., among other sources, according to the indictment.

A series of trials have so far found 10 people guilty of paying bribes in connection with the Olympics, and one has been found guilty of receiving them.

Deepali Deshpande has been serving the shooting sport for almost 37 years. She represented India at the 2004 Olympics. The Mumbai-born shooter won silver in rifle shooting at the 2004 Asian Shooting Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She has been training several players after her retirement. She is the coach of Swapnil Kusale, who clinched bronze in the men’s 50m rifle 3 positions at the Paris Olympics 2024. After winning the medal, Swapnil said, “Deepali madam is like my second mother.” This one sentence conveys a thousand meanings. After Swapnil’s historic performance,

The Free Press Journal spoke to Deshpande.

Excerpts:

When did you start coaching Swapnil Kusale, and how did you recognise his potential?

In 2012, the NRAI (National Rifle Association of India) organised a programme for shooting players. I was the chief rifle coach for this programme. Swapnil participated as a junior shooter. I noticed his potential and provided training to him and other players. Through this programme, we formed various squads for national tournaments, and Swapnil was in the national squad for three years. I have been training him since then, even as he transitioned to senior levels.

What do you say about Swapnil’s journey, having closely observed his career?

Junior players often perform well because they lack other responsibilities and distractions. The transition from junior to senior is challenging for shooters. During Swapnil’s transition, I invited him to Delhi and Mumbai for training, as he was practising in Balewadi, Pune. My other students were in the north, so I was in Delhi, but I made sure to call Swapnil for training. I wanted his journey from junior to senior to be smooth.

Did you communicate with Swapnil before his maiden Olympic match?

Yes, I always talk to my students before any match. I could not go to Paris; I was in Mumbai when Swapnil played his match. But I communicated with him. Students always share their issues with me, and I provide them with guidance.

What are your thoughts on Swapnil’s delayed promotion by the railway authorities?

Some officers do not prioritise players and sports. Despite Swapnil’s excellent performance, he did not get a promotion for nine years. It was his right to be promoted. He had to visit the office and meet officers, which he found humiliating. I also felt bad for his future. We eventually decided to focus on his Olympic preparation and set aside concerns about the promotion.

Do you think our system is unsupportive of sportspersons?

The mentality in our society is not supportive enough. People were unaware of Swapnil’s achievements until he became an Olympic champion. He has been a top shooter since his junior days, but his past performances were overlooked. People often get impressed by social media but do not recognise the true athletes’ real performances. People said he came suddenly, as an underdog and all, but he had given the best performance in the past, which people do not acknowledge or see.

Do you think there is a lack of sports culture in our country?

The mentality towards sports in India has changed a lot, and we now see many players excelling in various games. I hope our players will do well in the Paris Olympics in other sports too. Sports in India have become more professional, and we have started performing at the international level, but there is still a lot to achieve. However, there is a lack of sports culture in our country. Sports require rules, and our civic sense is often lacking. People tend to break rules, which happens in every field. Spreading a sports culture across the country requires awareness and a change in mentality.

After the disappointing performance of Indian shooters in the Tokyo Olympics 2021, the NRAI did not renew your coaching contract. Did this upset you?

I was not bothered when I was removed from national coaching. Having been in the sport for several years, I understand how and why such incidents occur. I decided to focus on giving better training to my students. Although I could not go to Paris, Swapnil won the medal. Difficult times teach valuable lessons, and overcoming them makes one stronger. I still hold this belief.

What do you think about the facilities available for shooting sports in Mumbai?

Mumbai lacks adequate facilities for shooting sports. Existing facilities started long ago and have not been upgraded. In a city like Mumbai, the climate causes shooters’ equipment to rust. Mumbai could have better facilities. Currently, only Worli has a significant shooting range. While there is no vacant space for ranges within the city, authorities could build ranges in the outskirts like Thane, Navi Mumbai, and Virar.

Do you think Maharashtra lacks a sports culture, considering it took 72 years to win another Olympic medal after Khashaba Jadhav?

In Mumbai, people play sports to relieve stress, but dedicated players do emerge. However, the rest of Maharashtra lacks sports facilities. Authorities should maintain sports complexes like Balewadi, Pune, and provide access to players as they often keep them locked. Existing facilities should be used properly, and new ones should be built across the state.

How do you compare the era when you played to the current era in Indian sports?

When I was a player, participating in the Olympics was a major goal. We had quota selections. I participated in the Olympics after being selected by quota. Later, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Abhinav Bindra won medals for the country, and our shooting infrastructure improved slightly, benefiting current players.",freepressjournal.in,2024-08-04T16:44:52.000000Z,https://www.freepressjournal.in/sports/paris-olympics-2024-bronze-medalist-swapnil-kusales-coach-deepali-deshpande-says-there-is-lack-of-sports-culture-in-india-read-full-interview

A meeting of the Ukrainian Olympic Committee did not commit to a boycott but approved plans to consult with and persuade sports officials around the world over the next two months.

The committee members voted for “consultations on preventing the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in all international competitions and a possible boycott.” The International Olympic Committee is pushing to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete at the 2024 Paris Games. They would take part without their national flags or anthems as “neutral athletes.” The IOC, which previously recommended excluding Russians and Belarusians from world sports on safety grounds, argues that it cannot discriminate against them purely based on citizenship, citing comments from United Nations officials.

Ukraine wants Russia and Belarus to be banned from the Olympics entirely. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said any neutral flag would be “stained with blood.” Also Friday, the prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania urged the IOC to ban Russian athletes and said a boycott was a possibility.

Ukraine boycotted some sporting events last year rather than compete against Russians.

Speakers at the Ukrainian Olympic Committee’s assembly meeting Friday raised concerns about Russia using the event in Paris for propaganda and noted the close ties between some competitors and the country’s military.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that if athletes from the two countries compete, “it should be absolutely clear that they are not representing the Russian or Belarusian states.” The United States will host the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

If the IOC’s proposal takes effect, Paris would be the fourth Olympics in a row where Russian athletes have competed without the national flag or anthem. The Russian teams at the Winter Olympics in 2018 and 2022 and the Summer Olympics in 2021 were all caught up in the fallout from a years-long series of doping cases.

The last time multiple countries boycotted an Olympics was in 1988, when North Korea and others refused to attend the Summer Games in South Korea. The North Korean team was a no-show at the Tokyo Games in 2021, citing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.

e3d8dac4-382c-4647-a9c4-c572e09b2ac3,Betsy Riley Will Lead NBC’s Primetime Olympics Show,"Looks like NBC’s new pop-culture primetime Olympics show is becoming permanent.

NBC Sports said Monday that it had lured Betsy Riley, a one-time NBC Sports veteran, to return to the company from Amazon’s Prime Video in order to oversee production of its primetime Olympics program. Riley, who was named a senior vice president and coordinating producer, helped launch Amazon’s “Thursday Night Football” broadcast and led its recent “Black Friday”; football game in 2023. She also oversaw Prime Video’s launch of its National Women’s Soccer League telecasts.

“I’ve worked with Betsy for more than two decades, and her experience producing the Games’ highest-profile sports makes her the perfect person to oversee the Primetime Show. She brings the unique combination of a live-event producer’s instincts and an Olympic veteran’s expertise,” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production, in a statement. “Betsy is a terrific leader and innovator whose creativity will be vital as we continue to build off the success of Paris and reimagine how NBC presents the Olympics in Milan, L.A., and beyond.”

Popular on Variety

Riley’s hire comes as a direct result of NBC diving more deeply into sports in the months ahead. Rob Hyland, the NBC Sports producer who led Olympics primetime in 2024, is assigned to oversee NBC’s Super Bowl telecast in 2026, which takes place at nearly the same time as the company’s Winter Olympics from Milan.

NBC is clearly planning to keep many elements of its recent primetime efforts for last year’s Paris Olympics, which curated the events of the day and used deeper analysis and feature reporting along with celebrity guests. Meanwhile, live coverage was available via the company’s Peacock streaming service. NBC and its parent company, Comcast, recently won an extension of its current U.S. Olympic rights deal through 2036 for $3 billion.

During past work for NBC, Riley took part in the production of nine Olympic Games. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, she was the first woman to produce Olympic track & field, and then produced all track & field at Tokyo in 2021.

A 2003 graduate of the University of Notre Dame, Riley started working football broadcasts for NBC while still a student. During her four years as a student she was also a member of the track & field team, and held school records in the pentathlon and heptathlon.",variety.com,2025-03-31T19:45:00.000000Z,https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/betsy-riley-nbc-primetime-olympics-show-1236352912/

Yui Ohashi, the Tokyo Olympics 200- and 400-meter individual medley gold medalist, is set to retire after her final race in September, a source close to the matter said Tuesday.

The 28-year-old national record holder in both distances, Ohashi became the first Japanese female athlete to win two golds in one Summer Games when she topped the podiums in 2021.

At the recent Paris Olympics, Ohashi could not make the final in her only event, the 200 IM, after finishing 12th in the semifinals.

The Shiga Prefecture native came second in the 200 IM in 2017 and third in the 400 IM in 2019 at the world championships.

Ohashi will swim in a competition for one last time at the National Sports Festival, set to take place in Saga Prefecture next month.

Since Los Angeles will be the home of the 2028 Summer Olympics, where are the 2026 Winter Olympics taking place?

The 2022 Winter Olympics were held in Beijing, China, which became the first city in the world to have ever hosted both a Summer and a Winter Olympic Games. At the time, COVID-19 protocols were still in place since the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics had to be postponed to 2021.

Below, we’ve rounded up all the details you need to know about the next Winter Olympic Games.

But it’s on the turnaround. Third-quarter results on Friday were better than expected and CEO Bjorn Gulden made all the right sounds of a company focusing back on sport rather than celebrity.

And, despite the contrition and the “our current performance is not good enough” rhetoric, the shares are on a roll, up 50% this year. Great for any shareholders getting in at the beginning of the year. The shares are, however, down 74% from their July 2022 peak.

This is a similar story to that of the world’s biggest sportswear maker Nike NKE. Riding high at a record $179 in November 2021, its shares currently trade 36% lower at $114.83.

Olympics and Euro 2024 Showcases

The total annual global value of the sports apparel market is around $200 billion according to market research company Statista.

And 2024 could be a record-breaking year for the sector with two major international events over the summer.

Kicking off on June 14, the Euro 2024 football championship plays out over four weeks snd beginning on July 26, the Paris Olympics runs through to Aug. 11.

The Olympic Games is particularly important. A global event that attracts millions of viewers worldwide, it’s the perfect opportunity for sports apparel companies to showcase their products — often tying in with sporting stars as their sponsors.

Among the new sports being introduced at the Paris Games next year is breaking (dance) — with its roots in hip-hop dancing and urban streetwear — which plays into the hand of brands such as Nike, Adidas and Under Armour Inc UA and retailers such as Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc DKS, Columbia Sportswear Company COLM and Academy Sports and Outdoors Inc ASO.

Nike is already the official sponsor of the U.S., Japanese and South Korean breaking federations, and Adidas revealed in June that it had signed up “B-Girl 671” — the world number-one female breaker, China’s Liu Qingyi.

Sales Boost Effect

Not only do these sporting events drive up the visibility of sportswear brands, but they also help drive up sales. During the 2021 Tokyo Games, Amazon reported massive rises in certain search terms: “Team USA Olympic apparel” and USA Olympic apparel” among them.

While the Euro 2024 Championship is unlikely to make any waves in the U.S., it’s a massive deal across Europe and, to a significant extent Africa, Asia-Pacific and South America — where football (soccer) is the predominant team sport.

During the last World Cup in 2022, retailers reported a strong climb in sales of football shirts and sporting equipment.

Thus, 2024 — with the double sporting fixture — could be a strong year for sales for makers and retailers of sporting apparel, providing the economic climate lends some support.

SEOUL, Feb. 9 (Yonhap) -- South Korea, Japan and China have vowed to bolster their cooperation to ensure a successful staging of the Winter Youth Olympics here next year.

The three countries reached this and other agreements during their fourth trilateral sports ministers' meeting Thursday.

Park Bo-gyoon, South Korean minister of culture, sports and tourism, Keiko Nagaoka, Japanese minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology, and Zhou Jinqiang, deputy head of the general administration of sport in China, met virtually and produced the ""2023 Seoul Joint Declaration.""

Under the declaration, the three Asian countries said they would try to spread the spirit of the Olympics for the future generation, strengthen partnership to ensure sustainable sports development, and reinforce cooperation in elite sports, anti-doping efforts and sports industries.

The three countries held their sports ministerial meeting in 2016, prior to a trio of Olympic Games they went on to host: the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. This was the first meeting since Beijing 2022.

Gangwon Province on the east coast of South Korea will stage the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics, which Park said will be an opportunity to combine the best of South Korean pop culture and sports. He asked for continued interest and support from his Japanese and Chinese counterparts.

Nagaoka and Zhou said they were looking forward to an Olympic Games filled with cultural events, and also called for trilateral cooperation for this year's Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, and the 2025 Tokyo Summer Deaflympics, a multisport competition for deaf athletes.

""We must make sure the spirit of solidarity and harmony through Olympics will be passed down to future generations,"" Park said in his keynote speech. ""This is the time to open a new horizon in Northeast Asian sports cooperation. Building on the unifying power of sports, the three countries must take the next step to become the leaders in international sports in the post-COVID era.""

Park added that a new paradigm in sports will be necessary as the world emerges from the pandemic.

""With sustainable sports that take into account the environment and the less fortunate, we must lead the world to a better place,"" Park said. He noted that the areas of cooperation for the three countries include: research on building a system for eco-friendly sports development; development of sports programs promoting health for the elderly population; and strategies to support underdeveloped countries.

The next three-way sports ministers' meeting is scheduled to take place in Japan in 2024, according to the South Korean sports ministry.

SEOUL, July 20 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's main delegation for the Paris Olympics left for the French capital Saturday as it began the quest for a solid performance at the quadrennial competition.

Forty athletes, along with 18 officials of the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee (KSOC), flew to Paris on the day as part of the country's delegation of 143 athletes from 21 sports and 117 officials.

Athletes for a few sports, including swimming, archery, judo and artistic gymnastics, left for Paris earlier this week.

The delegation for the upcoming event was the smallest since the 1976 Montreal Olympics.

""I am excited but at the same time worried (about the event) due to weather conditions and other environments in Paris,"" KSOC President Lee Kee-heung told reporters at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul. ""But I am sure that our athletes will be able to show their best performance and give pleasure to the people this summer thanks to great public support.""

The KSOC has said that the country set the target of winning five gold medals during the competition, which would put the country at around 15th place in the medal table.

""It is impossible to make a prediction. But I expect better results,"" Lee said.

It would be South Korea's lowest gold medal tally since 1976, when the country finished with one gold medal.

During the Tokyo Olympics, South Korea ranked 16th with six gold medals.

Fencer Gu Bon-gil will be carrying the national flag, Taegeukgi, when the delegation lands in Paris. He will try to bring South Korea its third straight Olympic gold medal in the men's team sabre event.

""I am thankful just to have an opportunity to go for a third straight title,"" Gu said. ""I will try to capitalize on this chance.""

From the 2021 Olympic gold medal team, only Gu and Oh Sang-uk are returning. With Kim Jung-hwan and Kim Jun-ho out of the mix, the veterans have welcomed Park Sang-won and Do Gyeong-dong, who will be counted on for some youthful energy despite lacking the pedigrees of the two Kims.

On a personal level, Gu, 35, said he'd love to win an individual medal for himself.

""My goal in the individual event is to win any medal, regardless of the color,"" said Gu, whose first team gold medal came in 2012. The men's sabre team event was not contested in 2016. ""This is my final Olympics and I am more confident now than at previous Olympics in all aspects.""

Table tennis starlet Shin Yu-bin will compete in her second Olympics, where she hopes her experience will pay off.

In Tokyo three years ago, Shin was a raw 18-year-old. Since then, Shin has won a few medals at international competitions, most notably the women's doubles gold with partner Jeon Ji-hee.

In Paris, Shin will enter the women's singles, women's team, and mixed doubles events. Shin and her male partner Lim Jong-hoon are currently world No. 3 in the mixed doubles and could be pushing for a podium finish.

""I'd love to win a medal in all three vents, and I can't really pick one that I want the most,"" she said. ""Everyone on the team has been working really hard, and I hope we all have good results in the end.""

4d60cc8c-6de3-4089-bc74-5aaa4cec6710,Ukraine steps up efforts to exclude Russian athletes from Paris Olympics,"With next year's Paris Olympics on the horizon and Russia's invasion looking more like a prolonged conflict, Ukraine's sports minister on Friday renewed a threat to boycott the games if Russia and Belarus are allowed to compete and said Kyiv would lobby other nations to join.

Such a move could lead to the biggest rift in the Olympic movement since the Cold War era.

No nation has declared it will boycott the 2024 Summer Games. But Ukraine won support from Poland, the Baltic nations and Denmark, who pushed back against an International Olympic Committee plan to allow delegations from Russia and ally Belarus to compete in Paris as ""neutral athletes,"" without flags or anthems.

""We cannot compromise on the admission of Russian and Belarusian athletes,"" said Ukrainian Sports Minister Vadym Huttsait, who also heads its national Olympic committee, citing attacks on his country, the deaths of its athletes and the destruction of its sports facilities.

A meeting of his committee did not commit to a boycott but approved plans to try to persuade global sports officials in the next two months — including discussion of a possible boycott.

Huttsait added: ""As a last option, but I note that this is my personal opinion, if we do not succeed, then we will have to boycott the Olympic Games.""

Paris will be the final Olympics under outgoing IOC head Thomas Bach, who is looking to his legacy after a tenure marked by disputes over Russia's status — first over widespread doping scandals and now over the war in Ukraine.

Bach's views were shaped when he was an Olympic gold medallist in fencing and his country, West Germany, took part in the U.S.-led boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He has condemned that decision ever since.

Russia has cautiously welcomed the IOC's decision to give it a path to the Olympics but demands it drop a condition that would leave out those athletes deemed to be ""actively supporting the war in Ukraine.""

Russian Olympic Committee head Stanislav Pozdnyakov, who was a teammate of Ukraine's Huttsait at the 1992 Olympics, called that aspect discriminatory. The IOC, which previously recommended excluding Russia and Belarus from world sports on safety grounds, now argues it cannot discriminate against them purely based on citizenship.

Baltic leaders threaten boycott

The leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania urged the IOC to ban Russia and said a boycott was a possibility.

""I think that our efforts should be on convincing our other friends and allies that the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes is just wrong,"" Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said. ""So boycotting is the next step. I think people will understand why this is necessary.""

The IOC said in a statement that ""this threat of a boycott only leads to further escalation of the situation, not only in sport, but also in the wider context. It is regretful that politicians are misusing athletes and sport as tools to achieve their political objectives.""

It added bluntly: ""Why punish athletes from your country for the Russian government starting the war?""

Poland's sports minister Kamil Bortniczuk said as many as 40 countries could jointly condemn Russian and Belarusian participation at Paris in a statement next week but that it could stop short of a boycott threat. He told state news agency PAP that the IOC was being ""naive"" and should reflect on its position.

Denmark wants a ban on Russian athletes ""from all international sports as long as their attacks on Ukraine continue,"" said Danish Culture Minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt.

""We must not waver in relation to Russia. The government's line is clear. Russia must be banned,"" he said. ""This also applies to Russian athletes who participate under a neutral flag. It is completely incomprehensible that there are apparently doubts about the line in the IOC.""

Asked by The Associated Press about the boycott threats and the IOC plan, Paris 2024 organizing committee head Tony Estanguet would not comment ""about political decisions.""

""My job is to make sure that all athletes who want to participate will be offered the best conditions in terms of security, to offer them the chance to live their dream,"" he said in Marseille.

'Very important' for Ukraine to be at Olympics

Ukraine boycotted some sporting events last year rather than compete against Russians.

Huttsait said a boycott would be very tough, saying it was ""very important for us that our flag is at the Olympic Games; it is very important for us that our athletes are on the podium. So that we show that our Ukraine was, is, and will be.""

Marta Fedina, 21, an Olympic bronze medallist in artistic swimming, said in Kyiv she was ""ready for a boycott.""

""How will I explain to our defenders if I am even present on the same sports ground with these people,"" she said, referring to Russian athletes. She noted her swimming pool in Kharkiv, where she was living when Moscow invaded, was ruined by the war.

Speakers at the Ukrainian Olympic Committee's assembly meeting raised concerns about Moscow using Paris for propaganda and noted the close ties between some athletes and the Russian military.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday if athletes from the two countries compete, ""it should be absolutely clear that they are not representing the Russian or Belarusian states."" Los Angeles will host the 2028 Olympics.

Potential neutral athletes

If the IOC's proposal takes effect, Paris would be the fourth straight Olympics where Russian athletes have competed without the national flag or anthem. The Russian teams at the Winter Olympics in 2018 and 2022 and the Summer Olympics in 2021 were all caught up in the fallout from a series of doping cases.

The last time multiple countries boycotted an Olympics was in 1988, when North Korea and others refused to attend the Summer Games in South Korea. The North Korean team was a no-show at the Tokyo Games in 2021, citing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The IOC barred it from the following Winter Games in Beijing as a result, saying teams had a duty to attend every Olympics.

Although the IOC set the tone of the debate by publishing advice on finding a way to help Russia and Belarus compete, decisions must be made for the governing bodies of individual sports that organize events on the 32-sport Paris program.

Those organizations, many based in the IOC's home of Lausanne, Switzerland, run their own qualifying and Olympic competitions and decide on eligibility criteria for athletes and teams.

Sports taking separate approaches

The International Cycling Union signed on to the IOC's plan ahead of its Olympic qualifying events to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as ""neutrals.""

Track and field's World Athletics and soccer's FIFA were among most sports that excluded Russian athletes and teams within days of the start of the war. Tennis and cycling let many Russians and Belarusians continue competing as neutrals. Other governing bodies are more closely aligned with the IOC or traditionally have strong commercial and political ties to Russia.

One key meeting could be March 3 in Lausanne of the umbrella group of Summer Games sports, known as ASOIF. It is chaired by Francesco Ricci Bitti, a former IOC member when he led the International Tennis Federation, and includes World Athletics president Sebastian Coe.

ASOIF declined comment Friday, though noted this week ""the importance of respecting the specificity of each federation and their particular qualification process"" for Paris.",cbc.ca,2023-02-03T14:58:27.000000Z,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/olympics-canada-russia-belarus-paris-1.6735805?cmp=rss

8cfad231-f9a6-446d-94e2-bd24c2871dba,North Korean team arrives in Paris for 1st Summer Olympics since 2016,"KYODO NEWS - Jul 21, 2024 - 18:54 | Sports, World, Olympics

North Korean athletes arrived in Paris on Sunday for the Paris Olympics, marking the country's first participation in the Summer Games in eight years as Pyongyang chose not to send athletes to the Tokyo Games held in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

About a dozen North Korean athletes have qualified for the Paris Games in such sports as gymnastics, table tennis, boxing, wrestling and judo. The competitors were accompanied by North Korean sports minister Kim Il Guk.

Pyongyang shut its borders to stem the spread of the coronavirus in early 2020, but returned to international sport about three years later.

The International Olympic Committee banned North Korea from competing at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, saying the country failed to fulfill its obligation to send athletes to the Tokyo Games.

During the opening ceremony of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea, the two Koreas marched together under a ""Korean Unification"" flag amid the easing of tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The two nations also fielded a combined women's ice hockey team.

However, a repeat of inter-Korean interactions at the Paris Games is unlikely as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un earlier this year described the two Koreas as ""hostile to each other.""

By Yoo Jee-ho

SEOUL, Feb. 9 (Yonhap) -- South Korea, Japan and China have vowed to bolster their cooperation to ensure a successful staging of the Winter Youth Olympics here next year.

The three countries reached this and other agreements during their fourth trilateral sports ministers' meeting Thursday.

Park Bo-gyoon, South Korean minister of culture, sports and tourism, Keiko Nagaoka, Japanese minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology, and Zhou Jinqiang, deputy head of the general administration of sport in China, met virtually and produced the ""2023 Seoul Joint Declaration.""

Under the declaration, the three Asian countries said they would try to spread the spirit of the Olympics for the future generation, strengthen partnership to ensure sustainable sports development, and reinforce cooperation in elite sports, anti-doping efforts and sports industries.

(Yonhap)

The three countries held their sports ministerial meeting in 2016, prior to a trio of Olympic Games they went on to host: the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. This was the first meeting since Beijing 2022.

Gangwon Province on the east coast of South Korea will stage the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics, which Park said will be an opportunity to combine the best of South Korean pop culture and sports. He asked for continued interest and support from his Japanese and Chinese counterparts.

Also on Thursday, the International Olympic Committee's Coordination Commission on the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics concluded its two-day visit to Gangwon. Zhang Hong, head of the commission, and Christophe Dubi, the Olympic Games executive director for the IOC, said they expected Gangwon to stage a successful competition.

Nagaoka and Zhou said they were looking forward to an Olympic Games filled with cultural events, and also called for trilateral cooperation for this year's Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, and the 2025 Tokyo Summer Deaflympics, a multisport competition for deaf athletes.

""We must make sure the spirit of solidarity and harmony through Olympics will be passed down to future generations,"" Park said in his keynote speech. ""This is the time to open a new horizon in Northeast Asian sports cooperation. Building on the unifying power of sports, the three countries must take the next step to become the leaders in international sports in the post-COVID era.""

Park added that a new paradigm in sports will be necessary as the world emerges from the pandemic.

""With sustainable sports that take into account the environment and the less fortunate, we must lead the world to a better place,"" Park said. He noted that the areas of cooperation for the three countries include: research on building a system for eco-friendly sports development; development of sports programs promoting health for the elderly population; and strategies to support underdeveloped countries.

The next three-way sports ministers' meeting is scheduled to take place in Japan in 2024, according to the South Korean sports ministry.

Japanese Olympians spoke of their pride on Wednesday after returning home from Paris with the most gold medals and podium finishes achieved at an overseas Summer Games.

""I believe Team Japan was able to lift the Japanese public and give them courage,"" judo's back-to-back men's 66-kilogram gold medalist Hifumi Abe said at a press conference after the country amassed 20 gold, 12 silver and 13 bronze for 45 in total.

Over 60 medalists including those from team events attended a ceremony in Tokyo marking disbandment of Japan's Olympic delegation. The gathering was headlined by back-to-back men's skateboarding street winner Yuto Horigome, men's artistic gymnastics winner of three golds Shinnosuke Oka and breaker Shigeyuki Nakarai, who was Japan's flagbearer both in the opening and closing ceremonies.

""We were able to elevate each other beyond our respective sports and it turned out to be a really good Olympics,"" said fencer Misaki Emura, the women's team sabre bronze medalist who was also a flagbearer at the opening ceremony.

Japan was third on the gold medal tally at the Tokyo Games in 2021 after winning a record haul for the nation of 27, and again came third in Paris after the United States and China both won 40 golds.

Japan won a record 58 medals in total while hosting the postponed games three summers ago, held without spectators amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
